Markiplier,Mark finding more comfort and solace in carrying around a stuffed Rabbit rather than a shotgun speaks volumes.
Markiplier,"Mark handled the fight with the poet guy surprisingly well, it’s a really well made mini boss with the fake people and footsteps, and he didn’t just unload bullets into the random ghosts meant to trick you lol"
Markiplier,I&#39;m so excited for this. Every video of this just consists of Mark wildly screaming and I adore every second of it.
Markiplier,Mark: listening to the ramblings of a madman that wants to kill him<br>Also Mark:*continues to wound up loud flashlight*
Markiplier,Mark: &quot;WHAT?! I defeated it!&quot;<br>Rewind to the moment that Mark sets the monster free to wreak havoc on the world. 😂
Markiplier,Mark learning that the bolt cutters can disable tripwires and immediately getting himself blown up by a tripwire while being so utterly confused sums up this playthrough perfectly.
Markiplier,No matter how many gaming videos he posts it never gets boring
Markiplier,"Ah, I always feel like good games just end too soon"
Markiplier,this man is so incredibly comforting. i cant believe it’s been 10. years.
Markiplier,The rabbit being held on screen is the relief this game needs
Markiplier,"THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PLAYING THIS!!! Also, hope you are better from everything it happened with you recently! And good luck with all the filming for your movie!!! &lt;3"
Markiplier,His fight with a blind man took more time than the final bossfight with the beast😂
Markiplier,"Ah, when Mark correctly deduces that he has to throw the rabbit at the creature but doesn&#39;t wait until the final confrontation to do it."
Markiplier,"i was just watching the first video he made of Amnesia about 11 years ago and he has the same energy it’s crazy that he is able to keep being him and not letting youtube or anything change him, will always love his videos"
Markiplier,"I&#39;m so happy to see mark play through and finish another amnesia game, it was awesome!"
Markiplier,Mark: “Oh no not the Germans!” <br>Also Mark: unintentionally releasing monster Lambert onto the Germans
Markiplier,Lol I thought you were going to die on the fall 😂 this man is super consistent with content
Markiplier,"I&#39;m so glad Mark commented on the shadows! the first time I played the game I was legit too scared to move when I saw multiple figures of people walk towards the door, but then fr felt gaslit when I saw nothing was there!! I even watched gameplay of other youtubers who didn&#39;t even talk about it while I was spooked af, I spent the entire area crouching while there was literally no one there except the shotgun carrying lunatic."
Markiplier,Nice to see that he finally finished the game!
Markiplier,wonder if mark will ever realize that if you show him the bunny on one of the blow upable bridges itd stun him and then you blow the bridge to kill em... would be fun to see a second playthrough
Markiplier,"I love how mark never changed from when he first started content creation, the fame didn’t change him. thanks for always making my day better mark :)"
Markiplier,"What a great horror game. I look forward to more like this.<br>Plus, watching Mark scared is a beautiful experience."
Markiplier,i don’t want this to end
Markiplier,Now i can finally pit this series in my list of &quot;things to rewatch over and over and never get bored of it&quot;
Markiplier,Mark holding the toy rabbit like it’s gonna protect him😂
Markiplier,"So glad this series finally finished (though sad to see it go) so I can read the wiki. (spoilers ahead)<br><br> Looks like Mark also technically got the bad ending (?) though the endings arent much different, and was <b>very</b> close to being right about the rabbit (it re-appears at the chapel after being used) and <b>very</b> close to getting the other ending (destroying a bridge while the monster is on it)"
Markiplier,This is the best thing that could have happened on my day off work sick. Time for horror viewing with a fever!!! It’ll be even better!
Markiplier,"There is another ending that is pretty much identical to the ending Mark got. During the final battle if you use the rabbit toy (at least this is how I did it) on one of the wooden bridges it will keep the monster distracted long enough for you to blow up the bridge without him jumping off said bridge. When you tumble down the cliff into the water with all the bodies, it will play out exactly the same except the monster wont come out of the exit and scurry off into the distance."
Markiplier,Mark: Finaly learns about fuel storage.<br>Mark: Finishes the game anyway.
Markiplier,The scariest part of this whole series was being forced to listen to the monster taunt us with beatnik poetry. &quot;We whirl the world.....&quot;
Markiplier,damnnnn we&#39;re at the end!<br><br>this was a great series and sad to see it&#39;s done but can&#39;t wait for some of the next series
Markiplier,i love this series. Such a refreshing new game for Mark to scream at.
Markiplier,I saw that this was uploaded and I screamed “YESS!” Then my little sister came in and said “did Markiplier upload again?” 😭😭
Markiplier,I love how chaotic these intros are
Markiplier,"we love you Mark, you are the best out there, keep it up!"
Markiplier,"mark always releases these when its almost 12 am in my timezone which makes watching it all the more authentic<br><br>truly the production value those sons of the forest linux users wouldn&#39;t understand<br><br>also, the way you&#39;re supposed to &quot;defeat&quot; the beast is by blowing up a bridge while the monster is on it, usually by throwing the rabbit there to stall it"
Markiplier,The crystals and the ghosts(actually ghouls of rebirth) are a reminder of the story&#39;s connection with rebirth
Markiplier,The voice acting in this game is amazing.
Markiplier,I love Mark&#39;s amazing reactions 😂
Markiplier,"Loved this game, it was fun watching Mark trying to figure out things as he went along, definitely one my favorite horror games in awhile"
Markiplier,"Mark, ive been around since scp containment breach, ao oni, the crooked man, etc. 2013 to be exact. Your videos have always been a pleasure to watch. Thanks for making the hard times so much better"
Markiplier,"Its been a while since Ive followed a playthrough of Markipliers. I&#39;m so happy I did this time. Congratulations Mark, its been really fun watching you play through this!"
Markiplier,i swear every vid you watch the more and more screaming is expected with mark and i love that
Markiplier,This game has such a good story
Markiplier,Amazing Series. Amnesia always delivers.
Markiplier,Marks &quot;Woooooo&quot; is the sign of the ultimate jumpscare
Markiplier,Seeing Mark get jumpscared by almost clicking the detonator handle without reading was pretty great
Markiplier,"Mark could not have been any more short sighted and unprepared for the ending, lmao"
Markiplier,"I&#39;m not gonna pretend I know anything about Amnesia, I just want to see Markiplier again"
Markiplier,Tylers accent slowly getting worse is my favorite part
Markiplier,"&quot;You didn&#39;t pay the cheese tax&quot; is a completely normal title for anybody who watches Mark&#39;s videos.<br><br><br>Considering how popular this comment is, this is the perfect opportunity to give my daily reminder about the fact that I love Among Us."
Markiplier,we need more hilarious animations of Markpliers and his friends
Markiplier,I like how Mark is dissing Tyler&#39;s terrible accent while he himself is going full Monty Python 😂
Markiplier,"Markiplier looks likes he hasn’t slept for 2 days. Funny animation, I really hope for more of these!"
Markiplier,Mark struggling to say Gloucester but actually getting a lot closer than Tyler&#39;s confidently wrong version was just so beautiful
Markiplier,"Mark to Tyler:<br> &quot;English, peasant. <b>Do you speak it?!&quot;</b>"
Markiplier,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWsTzkC0Clk&amp;t=1m00s"">1:00</a> That whole scene leading to Mark saying &quot;I said poor, not diseased.&quot; made me laugh the hardest and loudest I have in a long time. Paired with the animation, it only got magnified. It was uncontrollable."
Markiplier,I could see this being the actual story behind this ridiculous sport
Markiplier,"I didn&#39;t expect for Markiplier to release a fully animated video, but I&#39;m all for it."
Markiplier,As an English person these are the funniest English pronunciations and accents I’ve ever heard. Tyler being told you are a poor English peasant and going straight to a New York accent had me screaming laughing 😂
Markiplier,Personally I think a series of these animations should be Marks next project lmao
Markiplier,"Those who didn’t come from tiktok, are allowed to like this comment."
Markiplier,Bravo animators!!! You made that so much funnier than the original telling!!!
Markiplier,I&#39;m convinced mark and the crew are in a constant state of &quot;fever dream.&quot; I&#39;m all here for it.
Markiplier,"Markiplier has such great voice work in this, I need to see him play in a Dungeons and Dragons podcast at some point. Can you imagine the hilarity that would ensue?"
Markiplier,"Mark looks so sleep deprived, like he spent the entire last night studying about Cheese Rolling."
Markiplier,Mark calling the knight a &quot;sheriff&quot; is totally unsurprising but also completely unexpected.
Markiplier,These Markiplier animation videos are awesome!
Markiplier,"wait mark started by asking do you know what cheese racing is, then ended by saying &quot; this is cheese rolling&quot; <br>so.... what is cheese racing then?"
Markiplier,Hearing them try to pronounce Gloucester frickin KILLED me 💀💀💀
Markiplier,"I love the way this is animated. For some reason, the part with Tyler trying to do a poor accent and Markiplier laughing was my favorite just for the way Mark&#39;s eyes are animated lol"
Markiplier,"As a Brit, this made me laugh so much. Esp with the peasent /diseased part! Almost choked on my food and Mark trying to pronounce Gloucester 🤣<br>Amazing animation!"
Markiplier,"Of course this was made by ToonCee, she always has such a way with her expressions, they’re always so dynamic and, well, expressive!"
Markiplier,This looks terrifyingly as well as hilariously interesting
Markiplier,"i&#39;m just now realizing i&#39;ve never heard Markiplier do an English accent before, until this podcast episode came out 😅<br><br><b>edit:</b> <i>english</i> accent, not british"
Markiplier,"i love how that isn’t even cheese rolling, it’s a celebration where you roll down a hill drunk 😭"
Markiplier,I like that Tyler is still in the Markiplier friend group. I think I speak for all of us viewers when I say that we want more of Tyler in your videos Mark. We all love you.
Markiplier,"As a resident of Gloucestershire (pronounced Glos-te-shire), allow me to add some extra details here:<br><br>Yes, the Cheese Rolling is a thing we do every year. It&#39;s a tonne of fun, even if some people do end up in people&#39;s back gardens when they roll down the hill and don&#39;t stop at the bottom.<br><br>Also, it was official until 2015, then it was banned on health and safety grounds. So now we just turn up and do it anyway, just without an ambulance. <br><br>Welcome to Britain."
Markiplier,The amount of creativity for every sentence just blows my mind. Also love how every character is Mark or Tyler. xD
Markiplier,Markiplier always makes great content even during tough periods.
Markiplier,"Damn, Mark&#39;s videos always save me in the middle of a night"
Markiplier,This whole thing really plays out like your typical DnD session and the crazy shenanigans players get up to
Markiplier,These animations never fail to disappoint
Markiplier,"This makes me really want to see Mark play D&amp;D, as a DM or player."
Markiplier,"The animation, direction, and art style is so good! 😂 I love having clips get animated!"
Markiplier,"Mark always has to be the king, even in medieval times…"
Markiplier,ToonCee&#39;s animation gets better each video oml
Markiplier,That is the most beautiful thumbnail I ever seen... It brings a tear to my eye. True art!
Markiplier,The expressions in these animations is always on point I love it
Markiplier,I’m so glad this episode got an animated version!
Markiplier,Mark: <b>inhales</b> ...Tyler<br>Tyler: <b>immediately loses it</b>
Markiplier,&quot;I said poor not disease&quot; that got me shiting tears 😂
Markiplier,Might be one of my favorite videos. Just honest heart warming fun art. Thank you so much for this.
Markiplier,"haven’t seen these markiplier animated videos in a very long time, I’m glad to see that they are back."
Markiplier,That medieval sheriff&#39;s first mistake was thinking anyone in their right mind would simply give up a magnificent wheel of cheese once they got their hands on it
Markiplier,I always wondered about the history of cheese rolling. Thanks Tyler and Mark! 😁
Markiplier,"Tyler&#39;s face as he utters what I assume to be a mangled mess of teeth, English, and unintentional Scottish, is delightful."
Markiplier,"Damn that thumbnail of Mark is terrifying but haven&#39;t seen a Markiplier animation in so long but I loved this, this was nice to watch and great job by the artist."
Markiplier,"As a brit, hearing them trying to pronounce Gloucester is hilarious 😂"
Markiplier,I love how in the first Forest game they picked the best possible space to set up their base and in this one they somehow managed to do the exact opposite.
