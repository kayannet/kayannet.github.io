MrBeast Gaming,"I love all the different ways they fought.<br><br>Karl&#39;s team held them off from his base giving them the home turf advantage and pushed out when they were getting overrun. He also gave much needed motivation and encouragement. <br><br>Chris&#39; team had the aerial advancement bombarding his foes from above and divebombing them when they were out of bombardments. He was very tactical. <br><br>Chandler&#39;s nation were like bloodthirsty barbarians, just rushing their foes head on, going full on aggressive. <br><br>It was so cool to see and made the video so entertaining.",2022-08-28T23:05:22Z

MrBeast Gaming,"I can honestly see three Generals in each of them.<br><br>Chandler&#39;s strategy felt like something from Napoleon Bonaparte, who commanded loyalty and respect. When Napoleon attacked, he split his opponents in two and took them on separately without one of them knowing what happened. Chandler tried to do the same thing but got overwhelmed because of too much chaos and too little organization, just like Napoleon.<br><br>Chris&#39;s strategy felt like something from Obi-Wan Kenobi, he directly attacked Chandler and went above Karl knowing he was on the defensive. Chris always tried to take the high ground immediately, but was ultimately bested by Karl because he underestimated him. Something Obi-Wan wouldn&#39;t have done.<br><br>Karl&#39;s strategy was most likely inspired by Sun Tzu, he stayed on the defense letting the others attack each other, and when the other two teams were out, finished off the rest via a surprise attack and ultimately won the iTunes gift cards.",2022-12-08T03:56:45Z

Markiplier,"I think with this game it&#39;s the random map and well-distributed jumpscares and monsters that give you a sense of hopelessness, because many games have one path that&#39;s distinctly different whereas in this one, they all feel wrong.",2013-12-26T06:19:50Z
Markiplier,"I would have to say that the scariest part of this game is it&#39;s lack of direction. If you think of some of the scariest games Mark has played- Slender, Dreadhalls, Vanish, Dungeon Nightmares, Neverending Nightmares: One of the largest correlations is an open-map style game with a &#39;survive the night&#39; or &#39;get out of here&#39; or even don&#39;t have an objective for a large portion of the game. A lot of these games are randomly generated as well. The dynamic style and addition of literal choice forces the player to take responsibility for their choices.<br><br>For instance, I don&#39;t get scared in horror films or many other liner horror games because tell myself &quot;This is what I have to do, no matter what I can&#39;t change what is happening all I have to do it complete the objective.&quot; whether that be killing zombies, moving through the maze or closing doors to stop animatronics from getting in. But with these games, it&#39;s just about pushing through. You could have no idea how far you are to the end or if you are walking directly to your doom.<br><br>But that&#39;s just my opinion.",2015-02-02T12:44:34Z

Markiplier,"This game really exposes the fear of the unknown, the fear that at any point something may happen that is either scary or not scary.

Markiplier,"Man, it warms my heart to hear the old outro.",2015-12-09T05:31:45Z
Markiplier,"Markiplier is 100% right about the fear coming from immersion. Watching this, I don&#39;t find the monsters one bit scary, but the setting is. Walking around and hearing things, but not seeing them. A big thing in making horror films is that the thing you can&#39;t see can be scarier than anything you would actually show.<br><br>I am with him on the death at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUPzEEJpeqg&amp;t=15m28s"">15:28</a> not being fair.

Markiplier,"I have a theory (well, more of a headcanon but we‚Äôll go with it) that connects the events of WKM with Heist, Date, and eventually Heist 2:<br><br>After betraying all of his friends and losing everything he has, Actor Mark is trying to find a new way of life. He wants to have fun, but he needs a companion. All of the people he knew, he hates, except for one - us. Also referred to as ‚ÄúY/N‚Äù, ‚Äúthe audience‚Äù, ‚Äúthe viewer‚Äù, or ‚Äúthe district attorney‚Äù, we are the only person that Mark doesn‚Äôt have a personal vendetta against. So what does he do? He uses the knowledge he obtained from experimenting with the house to free us from our place in front of the mirror.<br><br>With a companion, he now needs something to do. A way to have fun while still boosting his ever-increasing ego. So what does he do? He goes on riveting adventures with his new ‚Äúfriend‚Äù. We meet interesting people, break out of jails, get deserted on islands, try to survive the zombie apocalypse, meet aliens, and so on. But there‚Äôs still an issue; we know what Mark did.<br><br>So in order to gain our trust, Mark pretends to be likable. He takes us to dinner, falls down a pit so we can save ourselves, cares for us when we get hurt, and even takes a laser to the chest when the scientist thinks we‚Äôre an anomaly. But it‚Äôs all a facade. We cannot be harmed in this world, and if we die, everything resets to a fixed point where we can try it all again. He even pretends to give us (very limited) ‚Äúchoices‚Äù, so it feels like we‚Äôre more free than we are. However, we can see his true self come through a few times, for example with the ‚ÄúMeta ending‚Äù in Date, or when he acts like a misogynist saying that he wants to go to the military base because there is a ‚Äútrusting man‚Äù.<br><br>In these intertwining stories, Mark is the hero of all of it. But, just like the Actor said, every good hero needs a villain. That‚Äôs where Darkiplier comes in. Whenever we meet, he is trying to tell us that what is happening is all just a game, and that we‚Äôre living in Mark‚Äôs made-up world. But Mark always tries to stop Dark in order to hide us from the truth. Think about it, has Dark ever tried to hurt us? He may seem evil because of his temper and composure, but are his motivations due to genuine malice, or just hatred towards Mark and a need to protect the viewer?<br><br>But Dark isn‚Äôt the only person who found his way into Mark‚Äôs stories. Wilford is also a character who interacts with the viewer. But unlike Dark, he‚Äôs here for the fun of it. He enjoys Mark‚Äôs new take on life, and secretly wants to spend time with the viewer to make up for his mistakes in the past.<br><br>This theory explains:<br>-Why Y/N is no longer stuck in front of the mirror<br>-Why Mark from Date/Heist seems nicer than the Actor<br>-Why Darkiplier is portrayed as a villain<br>-Why we see Warfstache in the choose-your-own-adventures<br>-What Mark did after the events of Damien<br>-How WKM links to Mark‚Äôs other projects<br><br>TL;DR- Actor Mark saves us from the mirror so he can have a companion to go on adventures (Date/Heist) with. He pretends to be nicer as to gain our trust. He portrays Dark as the villain to 1.Make himself seem more heroic, and 2.Make us think that everything Dark says is a lie in order to manipulate us.<br><br>It‚Äôs a little choppy, but I just felt like it was a nice way to link Mark‚Äôs dramatic projects with his more cheery ones.",2021-03-29T18:48:51Z

Markiplier,"As a published author nigh-constantly studying the concepts of storytelling, I thought I&#39;d share some thoughts about Mark&#39;s writing style:<br><br>Mark&#39;s writing isn&#39;t perfect. A few interactions could be smoother, some characters fleshed out, and some odd conveniences explained (such as the gardener in Who Killed Markiplier.) That said, he has two things that really set him apart from other storytellers. His methods and his moments. Let me explain. <br>I have never encountered a plot as bizarre as the Who Killed Markiplier series. This strange, disjointed style that relies on intrigue and confusion to keep its audience engaged... it&#39;s all wonderfully refreshing. By itself a good video method does not make, however. This is where Mark&#39;s moments come in. He knows how to toy with tension, and how to build to a powerful point. When the music swells, the world softens, and a few lines are skillfully delivered. This is so well done that even in confusion the audience still senses importance. Each video delivers emotion despite not providing any straight answers, and I can honestly say that is <i>no easy feat!</i><br><br>Will it pay off? We&#39;ll have to wait and see. Intrigue only sustains for so long, and if Mark can&#39;t answer every question he&#39;s created satisfactorily, he&#39;ll end up collapsing everything in on itself. We saw something similar happen to the TV show, Lost.",2019-05-28T07:27:41Z
Markiplier,"I get a really Handsome Jack vibe from The Actor, and I love it.<br>Also, my impression from the ending was that Seline had been Dark by herself, and the ending was Damien basically beginning to co-pilot Dark with her, that, rather than taking turns, they&#39;d be permanently together as Dark, both permanentloy changed.

Please excuse the long comment.<br><br>Mark asks &quot;who is the opposite of me?&quot; He mentioned before that Dark was the opposite of him, but in what way? Narcissistic, manipulative, and selfish. We&#39;ve seen Damien, and we know he is not those things. Celine is cutthroat, possibly manipulative, but for what reason? To protect Damien. Was it good? The best idea or method? Most likely, no. But she thinks about someone other than herself.<br><br>Consider the actor. So wrapped up in himself, so self-absorbed, that he can&#39;t possibly imagine being wrong. Being &quot;the bad guy.&quot; Everything is someone else&#39;s fault. He is incredibly selfish, only thinking of his own wants and desires. The actor is the true opposite of the Mark we know.<br><br>Actor says he needs a villain and that Damien will be perfect for the role. Damien remarks to Celine, rather sarcastically, that Actor should be careful what he wishes for. So, given the choice, what does he do? He becomes the Actor&#39;s villain.<br><br>&quot;The true villain is the man with the most enemies.&quot; Actor made an enemy of Damien and Celine. What better villain could Damien immitate than the one who stole everything from him?<br><br>&quot;Darkiplier&quot; is a character. A facade. A role.

It&#39;s like a bunch of mini-games being put together, like some of the Pokemon things like the contests in Hoenn, PokeAthelon &amp; bug contests in Johto, &amp; the Pokemon dress up in Unova.",2014-06-09T20:35:04Z

jacksepticeye,"Each of these games has an absolutely fantastic blend of atmospheric/psychological and shock horror. It&#39;s seriously a refreshing scene.<br>I also really liked the premise of the first game. It sort of, but I couldn&#39;t say why, reminded me of an H.P Lovecraft short. The story was essentially that this abominable monster lived in a dark cellar all of his life and had never seen the sun, the grass, or other people, and he spent most of his time reading. I forget how he learned to read but it was something like a caretaker. One day he finds a way to escape and he finally sees the moon, right? Eventually he manages to find a house and a mirror in the light and he finds out why everyone was scared of him: he is a monster and he never knew it. I don&#39;t know why but the first and second game really gave me a similar vibe to what I had when I read that story.",2020-06-01T11:43:30Z

The events of the original 3 nights have also changed enough so that they&#39;re worth replaying again even if you&#39;ve already seen how the 3 nights played out beforehand!

jacksepticeye,I feel like this is actually how Jack would talk to his kid if he had one,2022-06-13T15:53:30Z

jacksepticeye,"So I just watched the beginning of the episode and I love the things that Jack does in the opening, all the weird effects and creepy eeriness he tries to awake........but what makes it so much better is just the content and realization of what he is actually saying and that, in my opinion, is who Sean is. Thanks for the content man, really appreciate it!",2022-06-14T09:34:53Z
jacksepticeye,Jack just regularly takes care of the demon baby so well.,2022-07-06T00:32:59Z

jacksepticeye,Some people might think Sean is a monster for putting the baby in the oven but his reaction when it exploded was so genuine it&#39;s even shook me to my core,2022-06-22T04:57:58Z
jacksepticeye,"There&#39;s a lot of really respectful people in the comments who understand me and really support me and that is such a nice thing to see :D thank you guys very very much,you are the reason that I have any energy at all for my videos and I really do appreciate the love and support :D<br><br>Sadly there&#39;s some incredibly entitled people in the comments too who are lashing out and disliking because I decided to just do one video today and all I can say to that is &quot;I don&#39;t care&quot;. I needed time off to continue making videos at all. it&#39;s either get no break and upload shit for the sake of it or take a break and upload worthwhile content that we can all enjoy. Don&#39;t be greedy. It&#39;s only 1 video less on 1 day, you will live and I will be back to normal soon.<br><br>Spend the extra 10-15 mins you saved today from not watching me a second time to go do something fun with your time :)",2014-10-12T22:16:08Z

jacksepticeye,Glad the results came back saying you are ok was litrelly so releaved :D And you really deserve a break man i really dont know how you do it I was thinking about it becuase I upload a really heavily editied video once every 2 days and from recording to editing to uploading put together it takes just shy of a day as in around 23 hours (My interent is so bad thats part of it aswell) And I am always putting everything I can into my vids and people dont realise how much of like a push that is! Becuase yo are a normal guy like everone else but despite whatever cold your personal problems and whatever you are doing that day not only do you upload 2 videos but you upload 2 well editied cut down super energetic videos and that takes allot! So congrats on your results and all the best you are amazing man!,2014-10-13T19:10:15Z

DanTDM,"I am super sorry for your huge loss, the games narrator called you seven underscores. Very unfortunate, I have a friend who played that game, they got called seven underscores and never spoke to me again, their mom told me that had to go to mental therapy about seven underscores. I talk to them now but when I mention anything about underscores, they have a mental breakdown and go through in game cutscene dialog but you can&#39;t skip it. Whenever I say, &quot;that&#39;s nasty and crusty dusty slayyyy!&quot; They simply go offline and not talk to me for 2 more years. I gave away my dog once, he watched his new owner play an online game, he called his dog seven underscores online, I had to re-adopt him and take him to a mental therapist and the ER, seventeen years of mental therapy and keep drinking water after being called such a thing, good to go! Hope this helps!<br><br>Edit: idk why I wrote an essay about 7 underscores, ima rewrite it<br><br>Dantdm, my favorite youtuber, got called 7 UNDERSCORES!? I swear I will tear off the games narrators skin! I&#39;m so sorry Dan, I feel everyone&#39;s went through this before. And I feel bad and am super sorry for your loss of braincells! So I write this for vengeance! I once had a friend, we were playing fortnite. His other friend texted him, he called him 7 underscores, I told him he wasn&#39;t a good friend but he went offline, my mom said his mom texted her. Saying he had to go to therapy, his therapist said they were hinting at sending him to an asylum. I felt so bad, he got released and the second I mention anything about underscores he has a mental breakdown, when he tries to explain has a seizure, he died soon after. And once, I had a dog. His name was Roro, and I sold him because he was throwing up on my floor. The shelter called him 7 underscores, and he disintegrated. They put his skeleton in the yard to rot. I feel the best cure is 6 months of therapy,  drinking water constantly with abc soup, and more attention from friends or whoever you have. Hope it helps Dan!<br><br>Love, Pixolotl!",2022-11-25T00:50:56Z

DanTDM,"Budder orb would be awesome. Orb in the center, budder nuggets in the corners, budder ingots directly above and below the orb, and budder blocks on either side of the orb. It would turn the land into budder blocks so you could make budder apples and stuff and just have tons of budder.",2013-07-02T01:17:12Z
DanTDM,"The water @<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsCQpgmM2Pw&amp;t=4m02s"">4:02</a> was frozen.The block update wasn&#39;t executed ,because that was much more water in the lake than in the pond.You could break or stand on the ice and the block update will be executed and the block will be visible again :).",2014-10-07T15:04:08Z

DanTDM,wow this is a great mod i tried it and its AWESOME!,2016-04-16T14:35:48Z

I think IF xbox series S was able to turn off a bunch of shit it could get to 120 fps 1440p. Compared to what Ninja&#39;s settings look like and what the new update on series s looks like you can definitely see room for fps optimization,2022-12-13T08:23:47Z

theRadBrad,Appreciate the support on this series fam! I‚Äôll have longer videos after the next few videos. Thanks for all the love,2020-04-12T18:21:27Z
theRadBrad,The general rule about weaknesses is:<br>Humans - Fire<br>Robots - Thunder<br>Monsters - Ice<br>Flying Stuff - Wind,2020-04-18T14:11:40Z
theRadBrad,"I&#39;ve never got into final fantasy but this remake looks really good.<br><br>Your the best let&#39;s play host, theRadBrad is amazing.",2020-04-12T18:02:39Z
theRadBrad,Can&#39;t get enough of watching this!&lt;3 Pro tip: pair the auto heal materia with the healing materia on tifa to get it to work,2020-04-12T18:44:34Z
theRadBrad,"I&#39;m glad there&#39;s people who are enjoying this remake, I think its a GOTY candidate at least. It&#39;s not perfect but it would be unreasonable to expect that because people will always find something about this game to complain about, and having a carbon copy remake would seriously limit the depth and immersion of this remake so I&#39;m glad they made changes, I&#39;m glad you get Sephiroth in your face early. No mystery behind it just make him terrifying from the word go. <br>Sephiroth as popular of a villain as he&#39;s always been, I&#39;d like him to be a bit more disliked, similar to Kefka from FF4 who&#39;s hated by his own men because he&#39;s such an evil prick. I want to see an evil as hell Sephiroth. So far so good, seriously only a couple hours in and he&#39;s already got Cloud psyched out of his mind, I love it the mindgames already<br>Also if all the characters from the original game are in this remake then eventually Barret won&#39;t be the only character who can do ranged attacks. <br>If weapons and armor have linked materia slots that should mean that there will eventually be &quot;All&quot; Materia and hopefully &quot;Mime&quot;, &quot;Final Attack&quot; and &quot;Quadra&quot; materia hopefully.",2020-04-12T23:21:56Z

theRadBrad,My friend and I die a thousand times in this part üòÇ,2016-03-21T06:02:10Z
theRadBrad,"Am I the only one here who thinks this looks amazing?! Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve stayed away from games for soo long but I could never fully comprehend how people highly criticize this game, I think it&#39;s because they prefer the old-style Resident Evil games, fair enough - I humbly agree that they should return back to their scary-claustrophobic gaming roots, but in all honesty, had this game had another solo title other than &quot;Resident Evil&quot; - people would probably deem this an excellent game by all standards, just my opinion.",2014-06-25T19:54:17Z
theRadBrad,"During this part, we can pair each character with different partners. That triggers different dialogues.",2015-04-13T19:20:50Z

theRadBrad,"Hey brad, did you know the dialogue changes based on who you pair up with at the levers?",2012-10-25T14:30:12Z
theRadBrad,Those camera angle and PC control in that scene is the most disturbing thing RE ever pulled off.,2016-03-18T07:56:30Z
theRadBrad,Haos is actually ridiculously easy to kill as a final boss,2013-08-01T02:16:41Z
theRadBrad,When I first heard that line &quot;You better put a leash on that puppy.&quot; I replied &#39;B*tch put a leach on these bullets.&#39; I love this channel. I&#39;ve bought more games off of Brad recommendation them anyone elses.,2012-10-26T09:41:49Z
theRadBrad,"for reals, this is probably one of my favorite momments in the whole game. just the music, setting and boss. i really enjoyed this part, even though i know a lot of people hated the haos chase. yes i died a few times, but they all times felt like it was my fault. what? u wanna play w/ a no death count? play something easy like Zelda. i love the camera angles. cinematic, yet, they show you just enough so you know where ur going. only reasons i died was because of the part where you had to slide, which btw, your AI partner teaches you how as he&#39;s running in front of you. if you still died, well learn to adapt faster idiot. and if you were playing coop, which i was, btw, i had the thought after i died of sliding and so did my buddy when we both failed. the only other reasons we died in this part was because we tried to slide too late or too early. again, our fault. after we nailed that part, we had no problems getting to the rest of them. awwww, i&#39;m sawry if you guys are not used to seeing Game Over screens in an era where a game practically plays itself for you you, but no once did this part feel unfair to me and my friend.",2013-11-08T00:56:45Z

theRadBrad,"Hey brad,
Can&#39;t wait to see the new video commentary. Been an RE fan since RE2. Played it at 11, took me 16 hours to beat it.

For any other RE fans, There is a way to use the Sub-Machine Gun without using bullets as you would. Once you aquire it in the weapons storage room, point it at an enemy once you find it, aim, then rapidly hit it the fire command. You&#39;ll shoot one bullet, but will shake your gun and watch the monsters bleed. If you are curious to try it, go ahead and have a blast.",2012-10-26T17:20:58Z

I&#39;m really loving your vids, so keep up the good work! :0) ~KB",2012-11-17T17:52:41Z

theRadBrad,"I really don&#39;t understand why in some of these comments people want Resident evil to go back to the &quot;Survival horror&quot; style, if you ask me, the only scary game in the franchise was RE4, especially considering the beginning in the village, I never got scared from the older games and even then CAPCOM knew the games had also an action appeal as seen with the battle games and the mercenaries, I&#39;m actually enjoying the stories they are now making, it shows how the threat and characters have evolved from being simple cops and bystanders to the heroes of the stories and how the T-Virus quickly motivated the change for an even bigger menace, be it Uroboros or the C-Virus, the stakes are constantly getting higher and as seen with Chris, it can be quite tragic to lose those around you in a war you didn&#39;t want to be a part of and you&#39;re only there because of one wrong night at the mansion.",2014-06-01T20:55:38Z

theRadBrad,The fight scene between David and Javi was honestly so emotional. Just &quot;I love you brother&quot; gave me the chills,2017-05-30T03:18:28Z
theRadBrad,I noticed that the walkers from season 1 to 3 get skinnier because of lack of food,2017-05-30T13:30:22Z

theRadBrad,"The reason I think Tripp is still alive is, because if TellTale games wanted to confirm his death they would&#39;ve‚Äã shown his body splatter on the ground or they would&#39;ve shown it. Also because David and Javi jump quickly‚Äã to the conclusion that Tripp is dead without either one checking. It seemed like a weird jump from Tripp falling to his supposed &quot;death&quot; to Javi and David being like &quot;Yea he&#39;s gone, he died fighting.&quot; Those are my reasons ‚Äãwhy I think Tripp is not dead.",2017-05-30T02:19:44Z

theRadBrad,I think Legion of the Dead is a zombie mode that you can play either alone or with up to 4 friends (I imagine you&#39;ll be doing it alone). It&#39;s the same London map and whatnot but I think the red zones will indicate either high zombie density or hostile survivor camps or something.,2021-07-08T17:34:02Z

GameGrumps,"To be fair, I think Barry is a tad off-base when he says all characters function the same. Sure, a lot of forward attacks, up airs, whatever you want to say, are similar in function, but characters themselves are very versatile. Little Mac has the charge meter. Olimar has the pikmin. Characters like Kirby have only their body while characters like Marth have disjointed hitboxes with weapons, making priority attacks very different. Link has a ton of projectiles, someone like kirby has none. Some have up air recoveries, some have multiple or super jumps.<br><br>It&#39;s actually not easy for someone who&#39;s mediocre at the game and only plays one character to pick up another character and do well. Not saying Ross didn&#39;t do well, but the idea that you can easily play any character with one mindset, is wrong.<br><br>Still a great video.

GameGrumps,"Ross instantly became one of my favourite people after he folded after he folded on the pair of 5s. He saw that he was genuinely upsetting his friends so he fell on his sword and gave danny a fair fight.

GameGrumps,"99% of this playthrough is Ross beating the level, then resetting and getting stuck for half hour",2016-10-18T21:09:49Z
GameGrumps,Nice to see the guys from Mega Man pulling through in the end.,2016-10-18T20:04:58Z
GameGrumps,I love the level of challenge in Zelda II; starts off fairly difficult and slowly grows more difficult until this monster of a last level.,2016-12-01T11:40:33Z
GameGrumps,Wouldn&#39;t it be terrible if a flatline sounded like the Final Fantasy victory theme.,2015-02-27T18:04:54Z
GameGrumps,"Hilariously, the &quot;harpies&quot; and the bird-headed knights don&#39;t have known English names, and are known only as &quot;Fokkeru&quot; and &quot;Fokka&quot; respectively.<br><br>Which honestly sounds a lot like what you might shout when one inevitably jumps you.",2015-02-27T19:51:07Z
GameGrumps,"Emotional comment but whatever: it was kinda helpful for Arin to talk about the weirdness of funerals and the addition of flowers and &quot;happy&quot; things during those events, since my sister passed away last week and hearing someone say what I&#39;ve been thinking during a time like this was super wonderful.",2015-02-28T19:03:09Z
GameGrumps,I really really REALLY liked the animation of the Xerox era. I always found them so charming. Especially 101 Dalmatians. I think watching those films when I was a child birthed my love for sketchy artwork and animation. I just love rough sketches. I don&#39;t know what it is about it hahaha,2016-10-28T03:07:19Z
GameGrumps,"I actually like the style of the Disney 60&#39;s - 80&#39;s xerox style. ¬†It&#39;s rough around the edges and you can sometimes see the rough linework before cleanup. To me it adds more character and feeling to a drawing instead of it being so clean that it actually ends up &quot;stiffening up&quot;. ¬†Some animators used to say that their rough work would go to the clean up artists to get stiffened up, because the clean-ups tend to take away some of the added nuances that the rough artists did, by being so model driven and it would also take away from some of the animation because a drawing might employ an animation technique which would break model to pull off something.",2015-02-28T04:42:15Z
GameGrumps,Anybody else want Arin to do like a &quot;History of Animation&quot; series or is that just me?,2015-02-28T23:33:43Z
GameGrumps,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zECyScTeQ4&amp;t=8m50s"">8:50</a><br><br>I have NEVER laughed as hard as I did when Danny screamed there",2015-02-28T21:17:57Z
GameGrumps,"I think the king bubbles actually look like Sinistar.<br><br>Also 101 Dalmatians came out in &#39;61, and that was in fact the start of using Xerography due to the fact Sleeping Beauty didn&#39;t rake in enough dough to support itself.",2015-02-27T18:16:19Z
GameGrumps,"I really enjoyed watching this part. I agree with you that the leaping birds are the hardest enemies in the game to destroy, especially the blue ones. I know what their weakness is, though! This is a little tricky to explain: What you do is stand about 3 blocks away from him and do your best to shield off the swords that he throws at you. When he jumps over you, do the jump thrust when you are directly below him.",2020-06-11T05:51:07Z
GameGrumps,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zECyScTeQ4&amp;t=5m56s"">5:56</a><br>I couldn&#39;t agree more.  Those statues are supposed to have a 1-in-3 chance of providing the red jar, and that was the third time in a row that particular statue gave you the bird.",2020-03-27T07:10:24Z
GameGrumps,The depth perception made by the barred windows in this dungeon is really good for its time!,2015-02-27T21:18:24Z
GameGrumps,Last night I dreamt I was walking downstairs with two jars of Ragu and told my friend that I was down with the thickness.,2015-02-27T19:29:19Z
GameGrumps,I can&#39;t wait to see their reaction to the boss.,2015-02-28T22:39:27Z
GameGrumps,Real talk<br>I&#39;m not ready to let this series to end :(,2015-02-27T19:00:11Z
GameGrumps,I love Zelda 2 and the grumps make it even more enjoyable,2015-02-27T21:09:43Z
GameGrumps,Truly the Dark Souls of Danny&#39;s life<br><br>this series is great,2015-03-01T18:05:11Z
GameGrumps,"Keep punching through, Danny! You can do it! !",2015-02-28T13:06:37Z
GameGrumps,"Wow, Dan really got stomped on this run. This game is brutal.",2015-02-27T18:22:44Z
GameGrumps,"After watching Arin completely neglect his shield in Ocarina of Time, I appreciate Danny similarly neglecting his Shield spell in Adventure of Link.",2022-05-03T16:02:55Z
GameGrumps,The realest scream Dan has ever made happened in this episode. History for ya.,2015-02-28T07:49:10Z
GameGrumps,"Man, Arin is teaching Dan good thoughts about art lately (this time about shot language).",2015-02-28T00:48:53Z
GameGrumps,"aw, i&#39;m sad to see danny suffering in this level but i&#39;m experiencing a bit of schadenfreude as well cuz it&#39;s cute. getting frustrated means you&#39;re at least interested and that&#39;s all that matters to me",2015-02-27T20:01:49Z
GameGrumps,Imagine how much life Dan would save if he&#39;d stop body-checking enemies in an attempt to bypass them? lol,2018-03-03T10:17:31Z
GameGrumps,This episode was funny and I enjoyed it.,2015-02-27T18:49:19Z
GameGrumps,"Holy crap, it&#39;s not very often you hear Danny scream outright.",2017-08-12T03:44:05Z
GameGrumps,Let us all take a moment to appreciate the game showing its one and only instance of mercy by letting Dan restart at the entrance to the palace instead of at the beginning.¬†,2015-02-28T22:58:00Z
GameGrumps,Yes Dan! The Black Cauldron is amazing!<br>Gotta love Gurgi!,2015-02-27T19:12:43Z
GameGrumps,This is the first game I ever owned that I didn&#39;t bother to complete. I had not idea how to beat the boss. Years after I gave up someone showed me the trick and how easy it actually was. Even after I learned how I didn&#39;t bother to go back and complete it because getting through this last dungeon is simply a nightmare. I might actually dust off my copy now that I know about the life spell because I didn&#39;t even have that.,2015-02-28T00:47:10Z
GameGrumps,"I would love to see Dan replay this and actually do it well, like they did with the Mike Tyson replay.",2015-09-07T21:59:15Z
GameGrumps,What makes that harpy enemy funnier is that her species name (According to the Zelda Wiki) is Fokkeru. And she&#39;s related to another class of enemy simply called Fokka. So that&#39;s neat.,2015-02-27T22:14:07Z
GameGrumps,"Hey Danny, you know those bird knights that throw the daggers at you? The easiest way to deal with them is to hang back and wait for them to jump. Intersect their jump with an up thrust.",2015-02-27T23:31:50Z
GameGrumps,"I like that the last dungeon looks like it could of been made out of Toblerones, the scariest of all European chocolate bars.",2015-02-27T18:38:38Z
GameGrumps,I love the black cauldron too! It&#39;s one of my favorites,2016-12-20T11:25:39Z
GameGrumps,Is it just me or would the shield spell have really come in handy here?,2015-03-01T05:00:52Z
GameGrumps,"I don&#39;t know if anybody has mentioned this before, but the red potions actually restore more than 100% of your magic. If you pick one up, pause, then cast life before your magic meter is full it will keep filling it up almost to full.",2015-03-10T00:36:29Z
GameGrumps,Watching Dan and that statue made me think of &quot; Do you know what the definition of insanity is?&quot;,2015-02-27T20:02:48Z
GameGrumps,i love disney&#39;s dark era. the guidelines in their animated movies is nostalgic for me.,2015-02-27T21:51:12Z
GameGrumps,I really wish they named their link &quot;Buttlett&quot; again that was my favorite name they have ever used. It rolled of the tongue so well,2015-03-04T01:23:23Z
GameGrumps,The reason they make the flat line noise a pleasant musical tone is so that the doctor doesn&#39;t panic and cause more complications.,2015-02-27T18:34:20Z
GameGrumps,"<a href=""http://youtu.be/5zECyScTeQ4?t=8m52s"">8:52</a> one of the super real Dan screams XD",2015-03-30T10:10:40Z
GameGrumps,I flipping love the music for the Great Palace.,2015-02-27T20:52:34Z
GameGrumps,"Interesting bit of trivia.¬† In the Japanese version of the game, Link would start at the beginning of a Palace if you got a Game Over while inside, but in the final dungeon, you would get sent all the way back to the North Palace, while in the US version it was reversed.",2017-09-14T11:14:17Z
GameGrumps,"No one has commented on the vast difference of length this series took contrast to Wind Waker HD yet. Like, I know it&#39;s pretty obvious being 30 some years apart, but like wow. This series will most likely end on part 23; but Wind Waker HD was 73 episodes. And I&#39;m sure this could&#39;ve taken a lot longer had Danny not been using a guide, but just wow. Technology is amazing! :3<br><br>Also just want to point out how AMAZING this little short series has been guys! I normally enjoy them to an extant, but Pokemon, Wind Waker HD and some of there 1-offs are just fantastic. This one I think was another massively successful one Grumps! Maybe next you should do another Zelda title like Minish Cap.",2015-02-28T10:09:32Z
GameGrumps,"Hey Dan, you would have a much easier time if you used the shield spell more often than the life spell. Give it a try!",2015-02-27T21:01:54Z
GameGrumps,"Danny, you know this by now that you must fight your inner demons, and not run from them, do not run from the zelda monsters, FIGHT them! You are a warrior damn it!",2015-02-27T19:42:10Z
GameGrumps,This is why you don&#39;t put any of the crystals in the palaces until you are ready to beat the game. Each time you place a crystal you get an extra life. You stack the extra lives then do the final run.,2015-02-28T15:35:46Z
GameGrumps,198-FUCK! What a great year for music that was.,2015-02-27T18:55:28Z
GameGrumps,Restarting in the Great Palace after a game over is the one mercy this game shows you.,2015-02-27T19:37:49Z
GameGrumps,Black Cauldron is amazing. I think Arin is thinking of The Sword in the Stone,2015-02-27T18:47:52Z
Youtuber,Comments,Date
CoryxKenshin,Cory pretty much just predicted about half of the FNAF 4 lore...<br><br>THIS is why he&#39;s the greatest,2017-08-14T23:12:11Z
CoryxKenshin,Wow Cory was actually right on the theory about them being nightmares!,2019-12-14T11:41:25Z
CoryxKenshin,I like how they combined all 3 screams,2015-07-14T03:39:22Z
CoryxKenshin,Your last chance to try to defeat me. Try.,2015-07-14T00:49:31Z
CoryxKenshin,"Guys, remember how Scott said that he had a nightmare of Bonnie in his bedroom? What if this time we are playing through the mind of Scott in HIS nightmares.",2015-07-14T01:14:10Z
CoryxKenshin,I can only imagine how sick this must‚Äôve been back in 2015,2021-05-25T23:27:08Z
CoryxKenshin,This was the first video I‚Äôve ever watched of CoryxKenshin. This video means a lot to me.,2020-01-04T06:53:05Z
CoryxKenshin,The fnaf 4 trailer gives me chills to this day,2020-12-17T13:00:23Z
CoryxKenshin,Remember the ending to fnaf 3? Where we see the news article and it says that some items will be sold at auction. What if in this game we bought some items from that auction... perhaps? The things we got are now haunting our house? I have no idea but I&#39;m so pumped for the game!!,2015-07-14T00:20:44Z
CoryxKenshin,Crazy how Cory went from playing  the fnaf games to being in the movie,2023-06-28T04:31:35Z
CoryxKenshin,"This is my theory, Cory. The bedroom looked like a kid&#39;s bedroom. Maybe you&#39;re playing as the kid who was bitten in the Bite of &#39;87? It seemed kinda logical to me.",2015-07-14T02:12:13Z
CoryxKenshin,This was the VERY first video I watched for Cory I‚Äôve been here for two years through his crazy disappearance I always wait for him to come back and he always has üòá,2018-05-30T06:34:10Z
CoryxKenshin,"First theory: I remember one of the first pictures Scott released looked as if Freddy&#39;s hat and other things were under a spotlight, like an auction. So my guess is that someone bought literally everything found at each restaurant and now the things are coming to life in their house. The miniature animatronics can be explained as the toys you see in FNaF 2 on the shelves in the Marionette&#39;s room!<br><br>Second theory: The person who had their frontal lobe bitten off could be having these nightmares. My guess is that the traumatic event that happened to that person caused them to block any memories that has anything to do with Freddy Fazzbear pizzeria. Now it&#39;s all coming back to them and they have nights of terror trying to run away from the hallucinations the memories are causing them!<br><br>Fingers crossed that one of these theories are correct, can&#39;t wait to see a brother play it! And what gets me excited is that the graphics look so different from the other FNaF games, I hope that it wasn&#39;t just for the trailer and that it actually looks like this! „Éæ(<b>¬¥‚àÄÔΩÄ</b>)Ôæâ",2015-07-14T00:13:58Z
CoryxKenshin,"Wow, I had an idea like this since the beginning - having to hide from/ward off the animatronics inside your own home, or in whatever freaking house that is. I just recorded my reaction (But I&#39;m definitely keeping it to myself XD) and at the very beginning I just shouted at the top of my lungs, &quot;I KNEW IT!!!&quot; about five times. :P",2015-07-14T00:42:25Z
CoryxKenshin,am i the only one that feels like this is gonna make a huge success and scott will make a fifth one? in fredbear?,2015-07-13T23:45:17Z
CoryxKenshin,"Nice theory, it makes sense and would tie things together. I&#39;m very interested to see how this plays out. :D",2015-07-14T17:10:51Z
CoryxKenshin,&quot;I hope Freddy ready to get his ankles broke&quot;<br><br><b>dies</b>,2015-07-14T00:20:27Z
CoryxKenshin,"He&#39;s gonna get like 5,000 more subscribers when he play it",2015-07-13T23:38:44Z
CoryxKenshin,Pay attention to the player&#39;s perspective. You play as a child. You&#39;re eye-level with the doorknobs and only slightly taller than the bed.,2015-07-13T23:51:34Z
CoryxKenshin,Dude! I am so psyched to see you play this man!<br><br>P.S. - Glad to see you doing so well! Still remember when you only had 100 subs- Only up from here Samurai!!,2015-07-14T00:50:25Z
CoryxKenshin,"Little did Cory know, he hit the nail on the head with that theory",2017-10-28T11:22:16Z
CoryxKenshin,"wow this is the first time I saw the trailer on this channel for fnaf 4, I hope you achieve great things someday cory.<br>-Quinnlan Boyd",2015-07-14T06:08:31Z
CoryxKenshin,Looking back at this cory&#39;s theory is basically spot on ü§î,2021-09-02T18:08:12Z
CoryxKenshin,All I can say is... hype. These FNAF games are not what they appear to be. They are fun and scary but at the same time Scott has put a lot of thought into it. Enough so that even Game Theory had to try and look for a deeper meaning.,2015-07-14T04:16:47Z
CoryxKenshin,&quot;That wasn&#39;t a restuarant&quot; Lmao üòÇ,2019-06-28T21:42:10Z
CoryxKenshin,Already a trailer? This is insane! :o,2015-07-13T23:40:32Z
CoryxKenshin,I called it! I SO CALLED IT! I knew the final chapter would be about someone buying something they shouldn¬¥t have! And you can actually move in this one! THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME!,2015-07-14T17:08:48Z
CoryxKenshin,the fact that he was right when he said it was a nightmare is so funny,2022-02-07T02:59:24Z
CoryxKenshin,This video quality is so smooth it&#39;s like it&#39;s actual camera equipments on steroids,2015-07-14T20:53:53Z
CoryxKenshin,Bro really predicted the entire gameplay,2022-01-06T06:49:06Z
CoryxKenshin,Why does this remind me of Among the Sleep?,2015-07-14T00:57:53Z
CoryxKenshin,His theory is so accurate. Even from the trailer,2022-07-10T13:55:42Z
CoryxKenshin,The first time I saw this trailer I was much more scared than Cory was,2017-07-20T02:10:01Z
CoryxKenshin,"Cory, you should play Black Rose, it&#39;s a <b>really</b> good indie horror game, and it&#39;s for free on Game Jolt.<br>The developer has been reaching out for YouTubers, especially Markiplier, to get to play his expansion to the original version.<br>You won&#39;t be disappointed after playing this, and him knowing that there are people playing his game, he&#39;ll feel special again.",2015-07-14T00:07:04Z
CoryxKenshin,HYPE! I heard it&#39;s capped Bad Dreams or something but I know this is going to be super scary!,2015-07-14T01:10:26Z
CoryxKenshin,OMG!!! This is going to be sooo awesome and freaky! Foxy and all those weird little animatronics are so creepy!!! I can&#39;t wait for you to play it cory!!!üëçüëçüëçüò±,2015-07-14T10:15:47Z

CoryxKenshin,Wow look how far we‚Äôve come. It makes me so happy,2020-11-07T02:56:14Z
CoryxKenshin,Ho-ly cow. That trailer had the feel of an 80s horror flick commercial! Did anyone else get that vibe?,2015-07-13T23:51:45Z
CoryxKenshin,"Came back here in 2022 and laughed when he said &quot;this is it guys, the final chapter&quot;",2022-03-14T23:54:31Z
CoryxKenshin,Surprised that Cory figured out that fnaf 4 was all a nightmare just from the trailer.   Ok Cory I seee youuu,2020-06-29T00:29:53Z
CoryxKenshin,"I think it&#39;s a house because remember in the last one there was an auction. There were parts of Springboob in there and someone might have bought that home, hence the whole &quot;what have you brought home&quot; question¬†<br><br>Well, that&#39;s what I think anyway",2015-07-14T00:57:53Z
CoryxKenshin,"Considering the name of the springtrap doll is plushtrap, perhaps those &quot;few items&quot; that survived are the plush dolls on the security desk from the previous games. Perhaps you have to find a way to get the plushtrap out your home and every night springtrap (in the doll) haunts you with the phantoms (now nightmare) to kill one more kid. Or maybe it&#39;s a completely different spirit involved as there is Fredbear now too. Regardless, this is starting to sound like Annabelle the rag doll.",2015-07-14T02:43:10Z
CoryxKenshin,Maybe Scott could fit it all in the restaurant and had to take it homeüòÇ,2015-07-16T14:37:39Z
CoryxKenshin,I can&#39;t wait for it to come out,2015-07-20T21:52:22Z
CoryxKenshin,"Wow, that moment when Cory&#39;s theory was right...and He JUST watched the frickin VIDEO..",2016-05-26T17:46:04Z

CoryxKenshin,Scott really outdid himself!,2015-07-14T12:37:18Z
CoryxKenshin,The best part about this is that at first it seems all silly and weird and then suddenly it gets so dark the rest of the way... And then eeven darker... ...,2015-07-14T00:35:17Z

CoryxKenshin,This is how I felt when I was younger. I dont regret any of my past because it&#39;s made me who I am. But wish I would&#39;ve had this type of love and energy from adults for me. I&#39;m getting ready to start my own youtube channel now after having doubts and people who told me I couldn&#39;t do it. Thank you cory. Thank you,2022-02-07T08:40:09Z

CoryxKenshin,"Facts!! No one can stop you from achieving your goals or dreams except for you!! I love that you highlighted the fact that people will see you doing good then try to sabotage you by putting something in your head. I used to think that i would stay in retail pharmacy forever because someone told me that i had to be Nationally Certified to work at a compound pharmacy, but here I am. STYATE CERTIFIED PHARMACY TECHNICIAN, working in a compound pharmacy. The only person that got me here was ME. I loved this video. Very different from the gameplay, but it lets us know that you are more than just the surface, more than just a youtuber. Thanks for this. You just reaffirmed my beliefs. Hope your day is going good, Fellow Blerd ^-^",2022-03-29T15:28:29Z

CoryxKenshin,"You spoke directly to me when you said &quot;If you&#39;re good at animating and put time into it, you will work at Bungie,&quot; because since 2019 I&#39;ve been wanting to be an animator at Bungie, but I guess I am putting a limit on myself. I&#39;m currently working to get my Computer Science degree.<br><br>My grades are great; it&#39;s not anything I&#39;m struggling on, but I want to be an animator. I have barely touched animation softwares, but I know inside that it&#39;s what I want to do. I&#39;ve got so many ideas that I believe are good, but I keep telling myself that &quot;School comes first.&quot;<br><br>I also have games that I want to play with friends; in your analogy you said &quot;scrolling through TikTok&quot; and it&#39;s the same thing. I play games with friends for immediate gratification, whereas animating takes time to get that feeling. I always try to do something whenever they&#39;re not online; that&#39;s my window of time. If I try to get creative while they&#39;re online, I can feel their pull and decide to hop on. I&#39;m not addicted to games, but when down to 2 choices, between playing games with friends and learning animation, I keep choosing the games option, and every single night I feel guilty that I didn&#39;t do squat with animation. I choose to do that instead of practicing 3D animation, or practicing how to draw. It&#39;s a loop I am in, and like I said, every night all the productivity I built up for animating hits me in bed.<br><br>I&#39;m telling myself that I must take a course during any breaks that pop up, and play games with the boys on weekends, and hopefully that objective will be fulfilled. I want to create things. I want to create my own characters, my own stories, my own everything. But I need to start, AND commit, and both of those things are notoriously hard to do with any hobby/career.<br><br>I need to start man...",2021-10-06T08:40:20Z

Technoblade,"Because of this, I now believe that stardark only teams (since his previous ban) not that he wants to, or wants the hate, but because he&#39;s scared of situations or people like THIS going around targeting him in massive teams.<br><br>Yes it is sort of the old &#39;taste of your own medicine&#39; type of deal, but revenge really isn&#39;t the way to go.<br>It hurts both people that way.<br><br>It&#39;s sad really about this.",2015-03-27T00:17:23Z

Luke is an amazing example on how ex-staff usually act, and its sad. Him his friends or whatever they are just make the community even worse than it already is. Even though I dislike many people on the server, I don&#39;t go out of my way to target / trash talk and harass them continuously.",2015-03-27T03:18:52Z

Technoblade,"I have to say, i think baker 9 is the most powerful level 9, as if you have any threats at all with a regular kit, you basically diminish that to 0. As if you eat the gapple, you have absorption, 2 extra hearts. and 14 seconds of resist 2. It&#39;s basically a win in any small room and if someone is chasing me (and im below half) i pot turn around and destroy their face. Scout 9 could easily out strafe a baker on flat ground but baker is very good in tight situations or if you&#39;re being targetted.",2014-10-11T02:16:26Z

MegMage,"Also, you might find this hard to believe but Sten actually loves it when you acknowledge or positively respond to any of his jokes and sarcastic quips. That&#39;s why you got +16 approval despite the sheer awkwardness of your conversation with him. He also likes it when you show curiosity over his people and avoid making snap judgments.",2021-09-21T04:51:22Z
MegMage,"Before this game the choices have been pretty cut and dry, good/evil, but when I had to choose between killing a kid or killing his mom. I had to put the controller down and really think about this one. I ended up sacrificing the mom my first time through, little did I know, that there was a hidden paragon option, only hinted at in the dialogue.",2021-09-20T18:57:32Z

However, I will ask what your decision was regarding Connor - What was your choice?",2021-09-20T21:25:51Z
MegMage,"I actually love that you ended up with that Connor outcome instead of the others, even though it mostly happened cause exploring got the better of you loll. people need to realize though someone playing this game for the very first time and not knowing anything about it going in is not gonna get the perfect happy ending to every quest. How could she know that she had to leave and do the whole circle quest line and then come back to save Connor? No one would know that the first time unless you looked it up",2021-09-20T17:36:37Z
MegMage,"I always thought they missed an opportunity, Jowan was cut as a party member early on. You would be able to use the Gary Warden right of recruitment to force them to let him join the party. I thought that be pretty funny coming full circle from the right of recruitment being used at the circle.",2021-09-20T16:08:57Z
MegMage,It was pretty hilarious watching you stumble your way into what is probably the second worst outcome for Redcliff arc. I really enjoyed your reactions as they were happening.<br>In my first playthrough I went for almost exactly the same outcome with you except I took the burden of killing Connor with my warden. Not sure which is worse now but at that time it felt like a better choice than letting Isolde kill him.,2021-09-21T03:20:58Z
MegMage,"Respect you for sticking with it even with the horribly sad outcome. Sadly you don&#39;t get much warning (especially if you&#39;ve never played it) that if you go upstairs you can be railroaded into Connor dying via Isolde. You pretty much have to agree to do Jowan&#39;s ritual on the spot or, (since by this point I&#39;ve always let him go and told him to escape so it&#39;s not an option) you ask if there&#39;s another way to enter the fade. I actually didn&#39;t know you <b>could</b> go upstairs and talk to Connor without triggering the demon, and I&#39;ve played this for years. I think what messed you up was going to the door to Eamon&#39;s room, which triggered the demon to attack. Poor Connor :( I always end up saving him via the non blood magic way, but my warden is a goody two shoes who wants to save everyone. I personally despise Isolde for how she treated Alistair, but even I feel sorry for her since she clearly loves her child and the thought of a mother being forced to murder her kid is just so sad :(",2021-09-21T04:02:04Z
MegMage,"It was so interesting to see this outcome for Connor! I knew it existed but I haven&#39;t seen it before, as I usually go to the mages in the Tower to cure Connor. But I loved the voice acting of Isolde in that scene - so raw and powerful. It really tugs at the heart. I respect that you stood by this decision! I also love that you play Mynt as someone who sticks to her beliefs and decisions without changing herself to please other people. That&#39;s refreshing and fun to watch üòÑ",2022-12-07T05:02:13Z
MegMage,"Already knew from the thumbnail what decision you made (Connor&#39;s demon only shows up outside the Fade if you tried to kill Connor or got too close to the Arl) and honestly, I&#39;m not surprised. I made the same mistake on my first playthrough as well. It happens. The optimal outcome, if you aren&#39;t aware, is going to the Circle of Magi and getting them to exorcise the demon without any sacrifices. Unfortunately, not sure if someone already told you this but, if you&#39;re looking to be a Blood Mage, you&#39;ve lost the only opportunity to learn it in this game (not counting the expansion). Mynt has to confront the demon in the Fade to learn Blood Magic, which the other two options would allow. Otherwise, respect for not going back to a previous save.",2021-09-21T04:35:36Z
MegMage,Well I&#39;ve never seen that ending to Connor&#39;s story before... so thanks I guess for showing it? <br><br>I tend to go for the option that saves both Connor and Isolde but it does require asking for alternatives to the blood magic ritual to unlock and a vist to the Circle.<br><br>Also RIP Owen&#39;s daughter Valena since you didn&#39;t find her in time because you didn&#39;t check the final door in a corridor last episode.,2021-09-21T17:59:33Z
MegMage,"I love this game so much, the replay value and the branching choices are so well done.",2021-09-20T18:48:07Z
MegMage,"This is so crazy. I made an elven mage like you, but my mage trusted the first enchanter and the circle of magi, so I betrayed Jowan at the start of the story. When I got to this part of the story, I immediately was just like &quot;Yeah lets go to the first enchanter and circle of magi for help&quot; and didn&#39;t even think of any other options. Seeing you think and choose exactly opposite of me is so incredibly interesting.",2023-04-01T06:04:31Z
MegMage,"Yep, one of the darker solutions, stuff happens on first playthroughs.<br>Has your chat mentioned that Liliana is very handy with a sword?  I like to put points in her dual wielding and equip her with sword&amp;dagger in slot 1 and have bow&amp;arrow in 2nd weapon slot.  She automatically switches to sword when enemies get in here face, and because of her high dexterity can fight without taking much damage.<br> I also level her lock picking up to max because blowing chest up damages the contents.",2021-09-20T20:07:39Z
MegMage,This was tough seeing Isolde kill Connor but I am not at all unhappy you received this outcome for them. It really hits home that the game has different consequences for different actions each player may take. Getting to see your reactions to those consequences is a true highlight of this play through. I commend not re-loading or looking it up and this is really solidifying itself as the best DA:O play through I‚Äôve watched.,2022-02-22T17:52:51Z
MegMage,Dragon Age choices and outcomes are more complicated than Mass Effect choices üòÇ,2021-09-21T04:44:45Z
MegMage,Jowan is that one friend that just keeps fucking up and making situations worse.,2021-09-20T21:54:59Z
MegMage,In my first playthrough I also didn&#39;t get &quot;paragon&quot; result when it comes to Redcliff. I went with Jowan Ritual. If you wonder - there is option to use mages and lyrium instead of blood magic and Izolde but you need first to complete Broken Circle (Mage questline for Blight). <br><br>Good to see you fiddling with mods. Shame you didn&#39;t had more cosmetics at the character creation. I usually add 2 mods worth of hairstyles and colors which allows making more unique player characters.,2021-09-20T22:56:31Z
MegMage,"Those unique Feastday DLC gifts in Bodahn&#39;s shop are more dangerous than any forbidden magic. If a companion&#39;s approval level increases to the next threshold (where it gives a stat bonus and usually unlocks new dialogue options) without first completing the previously unlocked dialogue paths, then some of the dialogue you haven&#39;t yet listened to can and will become unavailable, which can lead to sequence breaking and bugging stuff with that companion.",2023-05-16T16:29:27Z
MegMage,"Ngl, this was really entertaining, and it&#39;s so refreshing to see someone actually not get the &quot;best ending&quot; for a change! Truly blind playtroughs are great. That said, the amount of friendly fire had me feeling a bit stressed...? Poor Leliana died a lot due to Mynt&#39;s freezing her and enemies walking right up to her and attacking (I believe they deal extra damage/can&#39;t miss if you are frozen, something like that, it&#39;s been awhile since I read on the battle system). <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a> Well, you seem to be having fun, so that&#39;s what matters. But ouchie! All those healing kits. Hahaha",2022-11-19T10:19:46Z
MegMage,"People who are fans of this game like to go on and on about the horrible stuff you can do and the choices that are really hard but when people do make them, there&#39;s definitely a certain Best choice that people have picked for themselves and so it creates this whole conflict of &quot;how could you do that&quot;. Don&#39;t worry about it, I did so much stuff my first playthrough through ignorance and I enjoyed it anyway.",2021-11-05T16:26:54Z
MegMage,"There are no right or wrong choices. It is just a video game and if there is an option given by the developers, there is nothing wrong in taking it. Don‚Äôt understand the complaints. Play it your way. üëçüèº",2021-09-20T16:24:51Z

MegMage,"Personally I don&#39;t get all the hate Isolde gets, she was a desperate mother who didn&#39;t want to loose her son, when a child is taken to the circle they&#39;re not allowed to ever see their family again, of course she didn&#39;t want anyone to find out he had magic.<br>More than anything I get confused when people hate Isolde yet are okay with Jowans part in it?",2021-11-08T18:45:08Z
MegMage,"Morrigan is intelligent &amp; quick-thinking &amp; likes it when player compliments her on same.  A practical/ruthless warden will find points in common with her, more so than idealistic, self-sacrificing warden at least.",2021-09-21T11:42:49Z
MegMage,"Wow, never seen seen that ending to Connor&#39;s story before, how sad. I always go to the tower circle and do the mage/lyrium/ go into the fade ending where everyone lives. I wondered why you didn&#39;t pick option two when talking to Jowan, &quot;Is there no other option&quot;. Seems like you didn&#39;t notice it. Pretty sure that is what opens the dialogue to using Lyrium.",2023-01-06T11:31:19Z
MegMage,I can&#39;t believe no one in the chat warned you about the DLC gifts üò®<br>They can break quests and if you gain friendship too fast it mean that you&#39;ll loose out on a bunch of conversations with your companions.,2021-11-08T19:49:15Z

MegMage,"I‚Äôm so glad she played Rogue before Unity, I think she‚Äôll be amazed by the intro of Unity and the new mechanics",2023-07-23T20:51:57Z
MegMage,"Achilles had been reluctant to acknowledge Shay&#39;s correctness until he personally laid eyes on the artifact. Both the Assassins and Templars believed the temple contained what seemed to be an &quot;ordinary&quot; artifact, possibly an Apple of Eden. There&#39;s even a moment when Liam questions Achilles, asking: &#39;Is this the Apple?&#39; as they look at the artifact. Inside the Temple, Achilles eventually admits that Shay is right and intervenes to prevent Liam from shooting him, finally realizing his mistake and showing a willingness to FORGIVE Shay (a contrast to Liam, who understandably succumbed to rage after witnessing Shay&#39;s actions that led to the demise of his friends and the destruction of their brotherhood; I also believe this is what led to Shay showing Achilles mercy, and the points Shay made were just to convince Haytham, which worked).<br><br>Liam&#39;s line stands out to me: &#39;I hope that world is a good one.&#39; He tries to make Shay contemplate the consequences of his actions ‚Äì while he did stop the precursor crisis, he inadvertently granted ultimate power to the Assassins&#39; greatest enemy, the Templar Order.<br><br>Both sides have their flaws. Rogue&#39;s tragedy is a result of a giant misunderstanding and poor circumstances. Achilles changed after his entire family died, and Shay was being heckled by Chevalier (among other things), which caused him to change his view on the Assassins. Then, after the journey back from Lisbon, he decides to choose (to me) the worst possible course of action and betrays the Colonial Assassins, subsequently wiping them off the face of the Earth.<br><br>In an ideal world, Achilles would have handled the tremendous amount of grief, and Shay would have calmed down during his transoceanic journey. The two could then have a conversation and realize the risks that investigating the Voynich Manuscript Temples brought, leading them to change the Brotherhood for the better.",2023-07-23T15:07:13Z
MegMage,"I think Rogue has my favorite Ezio&#39;s Family arrangement. Great playthrough! One of the things I appreciate about this game is the WEIGHT each assassination has on Shay. Killing people, even bad people, should be hard for a good person. Is Shay a good person? I don&#39;t know, but I think he tries his best to be in his own flawed way. Excited for Unity!!",2023-07-23T15:08:12Z
MegMage,That ending always gives me the chills,2023-07-23T15:49:39Z
MegMage,I think the thing that this game was trying to tell us was: not all Templars are bad and not all Assassins are good,2023-07-23T16:01:24Z
MegMage,Achilles says he won&#39;t forget what happened but the world will. By not telling Connor I think he&#39;s keeping his word by not passing on the information that he knew even to other assassins.,2023-07-23T16:40:49Z
MegMage,"A lot of people like to complain about this game that they effectively just title swapped the Templars and Assassins, but I think that&#39;s kind of the point.<br><br>We&#39;ve always seen this conflict from the perspective of the Assassins. But think about how our actions in-game would look from the perspective of the Templars, who also think they&#39;re doing the right thing.<br><br>Hooded figures stalking the streets under their noses, slaughtering their coworkers and superiors, always afraid that a simple bump on the street with a stranger could be your last action in life. Using poisonous gases and injectable toxins, or simply bombarding their victims with knives, bullets or explosives. We (the character) essentially are terrorists, just ones who we (the player) know are doing the right thing because it&#39;s a video game.<br><br>It&#39;s not a flattering look. And it isn&#39;t helped when, occasionally, an Assassin brotherhood loses their way like Achilles&#39; had. Suddenly, they&#39;re just terrorists, without the &#39;protagonist morality armor&#39; behind them.",2023-07-23T15:45:18Z

MegMage,"Well, I was going to share some thoughts on Achilles and his behavior throughout the game, but perhaps save that for the chat later. I would encourage finishing the computers and tablets for lore stuff though. <br><br>Now‚Ä¶ this is my third favorite AC game, behind only Brotherhood and ACII. I just loved the refinement of everything I enjoyed in Black Flag, the setting, the story development and I did love the story of Shay‚Äôs fall. I can totally understand not liking Shay since he killed Ade though. As for where Unity is going‚Ä¶ imagine me sitting here with a very Sphinx style smile as you are trying to figure out who the protag will be. You‚Äôll see. And I cannot wait.<br><br>I will quietly encourage one thing - after Unity, check out the two part comic story The Fall and The Chain and Assassin‚Äôs Creed Chronicles. If only for lore, they‚Äôre going to be important heading into what‚Äôs to come.",2023-07-23T13:25:24Z

MegMage,"Really great concept behind this game. Could have been more emotionally engaging, especially the assassination dialogues. <br><br>One thing I didn&#39;t understand.

It&#39;s an amazing series with so many great games even at its lowest points, The main theme song for AC Rogue and the ending is really symbollic because as you already know the series was born on 7th gen consoles in 2007(Xbox 360, PS3, Wii) and this was the last game before the transition for the ps4 AC era so it carries so many emotions for veteran players who accompanied the series up to that point in 2014, AC Unity is next and i can&#39;t wait to see you play! it has the best parkour system in the series, the visuals and the Soundtrack are also amazing! the problem with the parkour is that it&#39;s badly explained on the tutorials but i recommend you react to some people doing crazy things with Unity parkour after you finish a few sequences :) I can guarantee you&#39;re gonna be blown away by that game.",2023-07-23T16:15:36Z

MegMage,"ü•≥ü•≥ Congratulations on finishing AC Rogue ü•≥ü•≥<br>Hi Megue and welcome back. Well, I won&#39;t write that much because I saw how much this Game took you emotionally. So I&#39;ll spare you wise Words about this Game and who deserves or doesn&#39;t deserve anything. No I just want to say Thank you Meg for giving this Game a Chance and seeing it through to the End. I know not everyone likes this Game but I still find it to be one of the most underrated AC Games just like Revelations. I also found it very powerful that Achilles admitted at the End that Shay was right and he and the Assassins were wrong.<br>Thanks Meg for today&#39;s Episode and I look forward to continuing with AC Unity.

MegMage,"When Connor came to Achilles to study, he didn&#39;t say anything about the Neck. Because Achilles no longer considered him a traitor, but believed that the assassins betrayed him when they did not listen to what he was talking about. Because of the earthquake that happened in Lisbon, Shay just went crazy. After that, he decides to stop the assassins and thereby atone for the destruction of the city and the dead people. As a result, he became a Templar and helped them take power in the American colonies. But Shay, before going over to the side of the Templars, logically did not think that if the Templars had found this temple in Lisbon first, then the same earthquake would have happened, since they were also looking for temples. If Shay had just calmly told what happened in Lisbon, and not attacked Achilles and other assassins with accusations, then there would have been no assassin deaths. Achilles and the other assassins had nothing to do with it at all. They thought that the Apple of Eden was there, so they did not stop searching, but continued to search. <br><br>When Shay Cormac killed Charles Dorian, he found the box, he began to travel the world and look for artifacts. During this, he had a family and for this he was not surrounded by Connor. Later, his son and grandson followed in his footsteps and also became Templars. <br><br>Modern Templars, through the memoirs of Shay Cormac, found out that the Assassins do not really want freedom, but order, and the Templars represent the highest order. It can be said that on behalf of the Templars, the Assassins bring chaos, and on behalf of the Assassins, the Templars bring chaos. It says, but that the Assassins and Templars personify order and chaos. Everything depends on their actions. This theme will be explored more in Assassin&#39;s Creed: Odyssey. <br><br>At the end, the nameless Abstergo analyst becomes a Templar, and the nameless Abstergo analyst who was in Assassin&#39;s Creed 4: Black Flag quit Abstergo, and the Templars hunted him down and killed him because he leaked information to the Assassins.",2023-07-24T00:33:20Z

If you owned an Xbox One or PS4 you likely played Unity first, and maybe picked up Rogue later if you still had your old console available (and nothing better to play).

MegMage,"Achilles was told by a trusted Assassin (Shay) what these artefacts have been causing, and rather than heeding the caution, they decided to shut Shay down, and pursue the rest of the artefacts. Achilles was reckless and egotistical.<br>Shay on the other hand, did not chase them down out of mere spite, and a case of a fragile ego, the man felt responsible for every soul lost in Lisbon, the Assassins refused to heed his words, but the Templars did. Every one can say whatever.. but I say it again, the Assassins of the American rite, had to go. While Shay did not enjoy it, he knew it was necessary.<br>Edit; Gotta add that this is from my POV, nothing official.",2023-07-23T22:09:16Z

In 1763, three years after the Assassins&#39; defeat at the Arctic, the Templars launched their final attack on the Davenport Homestead, killing all of the remaining Assassins save for Achilles and Robert Faulkner. Convinced that the lone Mentor no longer posed any threat, the Templars spared Achilles&#39; life once again, this time on the condition that he give up his life as an Assassin. You can see why he was so depressed and had given up on the Assassins completely.",2023-07-23T15:23:52Z

Most people thought it&#39;s the Blades of Exile from GOW3, but no, it was the ORIGINAL Blades of Chaos that Ares bound and seared unto his flesh and then later ripped out from him all the way back in GOW1. I understood the references and I knew why Kratos hated those Blades. Still, in GOW4, the Blades finally redeemed itself.

The music is unparalled.

MegMage,I love how Atreus brings out empathy in Kratos.  It&#39;s not just a story of a father raising his son but how they teach each other . Kratos teaches self reliance and survival and Atreus teaches empathy and how to accept help from friends and allies when necessary.,2022-11-26T03:38:42Z
MegMage,"A fun fact: The story Mimir tells about a king from his homeland usurping the throne and all that, is actually a reference to the story Macbeth!

He stayed there for 9 days gaining as much knowledge as he could from the World Tree in Hel. Until the Tree got so feed up with him that it sent him back to the world of living, or &quot;spat him back&quot; as Mimir put it.",2022-11-26T23:29:20Z

You now have more options to solve a Puzzle. In general, a few Things have been designed differently, but what is still just as great (as in every other GoW Game) is the great Mix of Gameplay-Story-Level Design-Characters and the excellent Soundtrack. In any case, Thanks Meg for another exciting Episode of GoW and I&#39;m really looking forward to the other Episodes to come. Until then I wish you a nice Friday, have Fun and lovely Greetings to You and your Loved ones <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>",2022-11-25T08:17:48Z

MegMage,"Hi Meg, I don&#39;t know if you will come across this comment but I just wanted to tell you that I&#39;ve discovered your channel few days ago. It caught my attention how seriously you are able to emerge yourself into a video game. I am watching your old playthroughs of Dragon Age and The Witcher and I am absolutely in love with the way you are playing. I am that kind of person who feels really attached to video game characters, (especially those from the games you play because I got raised on them). I&#39;ve been going through really difficult time for me, your videos are helping me with putting myself together, and hoping that things might turn out eventually into something better. Right now I am more or less forced to stay in toxic environment (I come from negative and abusive family). While I was watching your playthroughts I&#39;ve heard that you also are a victim of abuse (I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s appropriate for me to write it here tho, I am sorry if I offended you). I just wanted to thank you for sharing your story and being as passionate about video games as you are, I am happy that I am not the only one who feels as much attachment to characters and the story as you do. It might sound silly but your positive and cheerful approach when you play helps me with becoming a more cheerful person myself, since I struggle with bad thoughts 99% of the time and I really don&#39;t know how to escape them.",2023-03-12T13:33:52Z

alliebeemac,Your boring summary is totally not boring thanks your awesome delivery methods and ability to place so much sarcasm into your commentary. Love listening to you! Here‚Äôs to a great 2020 to you!,2020-01-04T19:57:42Z
alliebeemac,"Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!!! I just wanna say I&#39;ve already watched through once, and this might be one of the best movie reactions/reviews I&#39;ve ever seen, and you know I&#39;m crazy for this kinda stuff. However I do love you and your content unconditionally soI might be slightly biased. Moving on to ranting along with a rewatch.<br>1- I would absolutely have watched entire separate videos for each movie, but you do an amazingly entertaining and satisfying summary review.<br>2- I get the necklace thing if it&#39;s very important to her and she wears it everywhere and wants it in the portrait because she wants it to be a part of her as a historical figure, but I don&#39;t think they ever show the necklace being important in the first film, and the necklace is probably a commercial product so there could be issues with that and the royal family seemingly endorsing that brand.<br>3- THE BLOG, OH MY GOD! Like I could see a blog being a cute bit of a way to connect with the people and humanize the royal, blah blah blah, eat the rich. BUT BABE, YOU&#39;RE A QUEEN. YEAH, THAT SHIZ HAS TO BE CENSORED AT THE VERY LEAST FOR SECURITY REASONS. And hell, stans get creepy and toxic over INFLUENCERS, let alone celebrities or ROYALTY who have an online presence. You make one wrong complain-y blog post and the next year could be people picketing outside your palace for Advisor #7 to be fired for being sexist to the queen, or worse she could literally start a war.<br>4- That crown.... first of all, bad design......... Second of all, Eat the Rich.<br>5- Oh, ye, last king was a HUUUUUUUGE piece of garbage, 10/10 agree with you there.<br>6- I do still like Khalessi more as a name than a character now, though I can&#39;t blame her for that writing dumpster fire. But hey! Great way for a Jo Schmoe to explain war crimes to their kid, maybe not a great name FOR THE FUTURE QUEEN OF A NATION, WHAT THE FUCK EMILY.<br>7- T H A N K   Y O U   M O T H E R<br>8- True... I love Simon, and like you say later, he did try to take the throne for the good of the nation, but still They hated this boy as a person 2 years ago, and he didn&#39;t seem fond of them either. 1 year later they&#39;re reluctantly chummy and 2 later and he&#39;s a part of the family inviting his girlfriend, the queen&#39;s bestie around?<br>9-This might be the one scene of good acting Melissa has, and it kind of ruins her characterization, because if she always acted stilted and unenthused and spoke without much flavor or passion, you could say &quot;Oh, well yeah, I know people like that, I guess&quot; but this shows that&#39;s not her personality. I assume something was going on with her actress, or the directing because obviously she can act and knows how to play the character but she utterly flops in other scenes.<br>10- YOU RIGHT! (seriously though you can&#39;t tell me the royal family doesn&#39;t have some 300 year old fir tree sacred crib.)<br>11- You can&#39;t &quot;The Knight Before Christmas&quot; Tease me like this.<br>12- Yeaaaaaaah, that treaty would just, not exist anymore.....<br>13- <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh1IFFoN8bQ&amp;t=14m40s"">14:40</a> Yeah, I don&#39;t always want to be this person, but if another royal looked at me like this immediately upon meeting me, I&#39;d be expecting some sort of proposition in the coming days, if you catch my drift.... not be weirdly antagonized for some reason.<br>14- <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh1IFFoN8bQ&amp;t=15m28s"">15:28</a> Okay, Amber is a dumbdumb for talking here when she doesn&#39;t even know what&#39;s supposed to be said, and she doesn&#39;t wait nearly long enough, BUT LIKE WHY DOES RICHARD NOT DO THE THING?! THIS IS SO CONTRIVED. AT LEAST SHOW US RICHARD BEING NERVOUS OR LOST FOR WORDS OR TRIPPING UP, TO GIVE SOME EXPLANATION OF WHY AMBER WOULD FEEL THE NEED TO STEP IN.<br>15- A.... Amber.... Put your leg on your knee...... Like I get it, I have to touch those kinds of slippers to get them on right, and it&#39;d probably be even harder and more uncomfy to walk in if your feet were swollen and sore from being 9 months preggers..... but like???? Why are you moaning and whimpering like this is some weird kinky walkytalky play???? Or like you&#39;re going into labour or something?? Just say &quot;Ugh, I can&#39;t get my slipper on.&quot;<br>16- &quot;Either queen&quot; okay but this kind of contradicts their reasoning later of why Ming wouldn&#39;t sign the treaty, because if Ty and Ming said &quot;Amber CAN&#39;T sign the treaty because Ming doesn&#39;t want to also do it&quot;..... that&#39;s kinda dickish. If they&#39;d explained it as &quot;Well, Ty and Ming decided only Ty would sign and thus it&#39;d be uncouth for you to sign it, and you really shouldn&#39;t as it&#39;d be kind of disrespectful of Ming&quot; that&#39;d make sense, but this line exists, and thus it implies Ty and Ming said this and therefore are dicks, which doesn&#39;t fit with later their characterization at all.<br>17- The blatant misdirect of Lynn being the only one who doesn&#39;t react. Have I said I love Lynn and they don&#39;t do her justice?? <b>Because I love Lynn and they don&#39;t do her justice....</b><br>18- Okay..... First of all.... Neither of them are disrupting the peace... So either both of them would have their firstborn cursed for not drafting a new treaty immediately (_witch_ I&#39;d like to argue would be stupid terms for a curse of this sort especially given there are no terms to lift the curse by continuing the peace and cursing one person who probably has ZERO weight in this decision is so dumb and not a good motive to keep the treaty but WHATEVER), or neither of them would because they aren&#39;t the ones keeping it from being signed, Little is and therefore his firstborn would probably be the one to be cursed in that case, especially considering the previous line says this spell was cast on CLAUDE and his family, and we can assume Jun and his family, so the current ruling families might not even be covered under the curse.  SECOND OF ALL, THE CURSE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ACTIVATED BY WHOEVER KILLED CLAUDE, AS THEY DISRUPTED THE PEACE, ESPECIALLY IF IT WAS JUN, HIS WIFE, OR SOMEONE IN THEIR FAMILY. Third, why is anyone even entertaining this? Even if magic is a provably real thing in this world, which X to doubt since we&#39;ve heard nothing of it before, but hey, maybe it went extinct because..... magic was hereditary and the witch trials were &quot;successful&quot; even though I don&#39;t really think genetics would allow that to work but benefit of the doubt it did.... It literally says right there, no one even knows if it was cast... And all the above reasons I&#39;ve stated for why it probably wouldn&#39;t work. Come on.<br>19- I mean it was the dumbest possible motive ever, so I don&#39;t blame her for believing him instantly.... But why haven&#39;t they already started ransacking every room in the castle whether suspect or not?? I mean clearly people don&#39;t lock their doors, so the treaty could be hidden in people&#39;s rooms without them knowing.<br>20- PRINCESS ZOEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!! ‚ô•<br>21- <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh1IFFoN8bQ&amp;t=27m51s"">27:51</a> Water-feature at a 9 month pregnant baby shower seems like just asking for trouble.<br>22- Yeah, that reveal of the issue with Ming signing and dealing with it is super unsatisfying.<br>23- I... love??? Ty and Ming?????? I love Ty and Ming. That&#39;s all. I just love them.<br>24-....... ONE Dude confirms this myth of haunted Dungeons??? WeeOoo WeeOoo... <br>25- Simon is cute. But also there&#39;s NO reason to believe he&#39;s the thief... MAYBE trying to sabotage Amber and Richard&#39;s rule, if he&#39;d even been shown to hold a grudge over not getting the throne, but he hasn&#39;t? He pretty much immediately hitched himself to their team once they became King and Queen, and has done nothing but help them and establish himself as a part of their family since. Which kinda doesn&#39;t make sense, but it does kinda clear him of having a motive here.<br>26- This bullseye scene is nonsense, and she doesn&#39;t faint quick enough to make it funny and coincidental, it ends up coming off as &quot;Amber can get a bullseye right before fainting!! Better than Ming without fainting!&quot; which is just... no, considering we haven&#39;t been shown any reason for that skill. C&#39;mon...<br>27- I love Ty and Ming.....<br>28- Richard&#39;s an idiot.<br>29- Emily is definitely getting an injury from that fall you can&#39;t pull a fast one on me movie...<br>30- Now see I would&#39;ve forgiven the nonsense of no one questioning ONE GUY claiming the myth is real and the dungeons are haunted..... if we got confirmation the dungeons were haunted.... Like they hear tortured moaning, and suddenly the door mysteriously unlocked and opened. At least distract us from your nonsense, Movie.....<br>31- I mean fuck the curse, there&#39;s LITERALLY a woman in labour and WE&#39;RE WASTING TIME EXPLAINING SOME CLUE BULLSHIT. Amber MUST be in agonizing pain right now...<br>32-..... Okay, very cute moment, love Ming, but I&#39;m guessing Ty gave her that?? Or her parents or siblings or in laws.....? Yet she&#39;s just gonna give it to Amber? Couldn&#39;t she order a new one and send it to her? The fuck? That&#39;s a big ass gift for someone you just met, did some shit go on we didn&#39;t get to see?<br>33- Sooooo, Amber only updates her blog on a weekly basis with cookie cutter &quot;love my subjects, doing stuff this week, new baby says hi&quot; statements? Good to know.... What a job.<br><br>Loved the video and would kill to see more!!! Hope the wedding was great!!!",2020-01-03T04:22:53Z

alliebeemac,I think you should play Detroit become human I think u would like it‚Äôs kinda like life is strange but no turning back time and people potentially dying which puts a lot of pressure on the player and the game has 3 stories and each one is really good with them all connecting with each other  I think you should try the game there‚Äôs a demo and that Demo pretty good it‚Äôs in the PlayStation store and the demo even convinced me to get the game I think it‚Äôs worth a try,2019-03-24T07:41:18Z

alliebeemac,"I would like to point out the fact that it&#39;s been 20 years since anybody could have a kid in the half life universe. That means most adults that survived the invasion are incapable of creating children. So that means only the people who grew up in this world are capable of having kids. The human population is probably extremely depleted at this point. Especially with many humans joining the combine overwatch in order to survive, and the seven hour war probably killing the majority of the population of earth. With all that said, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable to ask people to consider having kids at the time. Especially if the Combine can eventually reactivate the Suppression Field.

alliebeemac,"The reason the Nazis were probably so advanced in this time line is because they were. Kind of like the invention of the first rocket. The V1 V2 first war rockets that were already flying to the coast of Britain. That was unimaginable at the time. The Nazis and the German technicians consistently exceeded what was considered impossible with their technology. Which leads back to the work and perfectionist mentality of the Germans. Germany was called the land of poets and thinkers. That&#39;s really how it was known. I don&#39;t know why almost nobody knows about it anymore. But if you look at the inventions and poets of the Germans, you can see why. The first car, first computers, telephone, jet engine.<br><br>The simple reason why the Nazis have the atom bomb in this timeline is probably that the German scientists who invented the atom bomb in America had to stay in Germany. People like Albert Einstein. Thus, the Nazis were able to develop the atomic bomb first. To this day, historians are undecided on how close the Nazis got to the atomic bomb. In fact, the Nazis were close to development even WITHOUT the important scientists who then fled to America. But only in theory. The big problem was the resources. The Nazis fought against all major powers at the same time and therefore had no resources with which to build the atomic bomb. The resources, with the stupidity of Hitler and the high command, were ultimately the decisive point why the Third Reich fell. They had the strength, engineering and tactics. Strongest army in history. But Because of their own stupidity and greed, they fell. I wish Stauffenberg had made it...",2023-06-12T11:10:34Z

alliebeemac,"@alliebeemac: The reason why you where so confused at the ending after the epilogue, to why the narrator did not fix thing, it was because your suppose to bring the bucket to the new content door, so you have the bucket to the introduction of the jump circle you would understand what is going on and then bring the bucket to the new content door it would show return to stanley parable 2 exibit, and since the narrator did not relize you have the bucket their is a new ending by bringing the bucket too the reasurance bucket at this point do not exit throught the stairs because if you do the title will return back to 2, and you will missout on the new title screen and to fix it you have to go through the epilogue again.  You can return to the skip button after the epilogue, it is in the executive bathroom mirror, I do not know if bringing the bucket to the introduction of the stanley parable is required to unlock the return of does ending, or they where just added in after the update.",2023-02-13T01:50:23Z

Did you do the click the door 430 5 time if you did I don&#39;t remember, their is also a bucket version.   You miss answer the phone without the bucket in the dark room,  unplug the phone without the bucket in the dark room part of the original ending and one of the truth ending of the original ending and this is also the rest of the missing confusion ending that is missing,   unplug the phone with the bucket in the dark room for one of the truth ending to the stanley parable 2.  You miss out the window without bucket the yes option, you miss answer 434 phone without bucket part of the original they are 3 diffrent message and only one message gives you the box ending which is also in the original, you can answer 434 phone with the bucket for a new message involving the bucket but their is only one new message with bucket.  Heaven ending, some computer that stanley can&#39;t turn off one will show awaiting input, by doing input receive and begining the game it will change to a diffrent computer that you can&#39;t turn off, the 3rd time is in the boss receptionist desk, and the 5th and last input is Stanley computer that is part of the original ending, their is not bucket version since the door normal shut down they are a few instance where the door remain open so you can bring the bucket to heaven, you will just be holding a bucket in heaven nothing else is different.   Escape pod ending without the bucket go to the boss office, and step out of the double door office just before the door close interupting the narrator that stays in the boss office, the 428 door will be open and each floor you climb look out the window you will understand why the normal elevator does not go anywhere, once you reach the escape pod room walk strait into the darkness, because if you walk backward for some light you will miss the visual that is part of the original ending, doing it with the bucket will be new and that is the only way to have the bucket in the epilogue also if you do the escape pod ending with the bucket you will lose the bucket for one ending, and if you need the bucket right away just begin the game again to have a replacement bucket.

This is the problem with these kinds of embargoes: everyone stops showing vids, so there&#39;s no clear way to know exactly when the embargo is over, other than trusting what SQEX said (and then you have to ask yourself if you really want to trust what SQEX said, and it all gets messy).",2020-04-29T01:00:32Z

You should be fine to stream it on twitch (sadly not youtube) but they have been striking people who are posting chapter 18 play through&#39;s using capture cards to get around the streaming block. Its absolute bullshit and scummy of Sony to do that, but it is what it is. No one that has streamed it on twitch that I am aware of has had any issues. And eventually Sony will probably lift the block. I am sure they are doing it to protect the story.

Send tweet.<br>-The acceptance my brain automatically had about you eating a whole ass lemon like an apple before realizing it was ungodly is downright unacceptable. <br>-The secondary intro is vee cozy.<br>-1/3 a bottle down, lets goooooooo.<br>-Two thoughts, Bella does sound like a normal teen, but also this sounds like a first draft so far.<br>-OKAY, HOW FUCKIN&#39; DARE YOU MAKE ME AWARE OF THE MUCH MORE INTERESTING TIMELINE WHERE BELLA FINDS OUT EDWARDS A VAMPIRE BECAUSE SHE TRIES TO KILL AND BURY HIM AND HE COMES THE FUCK BACK. <i>HOW DARE YOU!</i><br>-Charlie???? Not ramen??? Not instant mac and cheese??? Not spaghetti??? Not spaghettios or soup???? Not dino nuggies?? I pray to god this is just an assumption on Bella&#39;s part, bc otherwise how tf is he alive????<br>-HE DID WHAT WHEN WHO DID WHAT???<br>- <i>WHY HAVE PEOPLE BEEN SAYING THIS MAN IS A WHOLESOME DILF?! I WANT TO HURT HIM PHYSICALLY, EMOTIONALLY, AND MENTALLY.</i><br>-You&#39;re right about the texting thing and you should say it.<br>-I&#39;m distracted by the cute, comfy looking sweater.<br>-Love the critic about recognizing toxicity in media, and Bella&#39;s failure to. I am nourished, thank you, bestest tofu cube.<br>-No that is not gun safe. You shouldn&#39;t hang a gun on a belt on a coat rack period, it could fall and misfire.<br>-Pointing it out is still funny, Steph gets ONE point.<br>-NAH, DRAG HIM QUEEN. You don&#39;t get to complain if you expect other people to cook for you. You want better food, learn to make better food.<br>-I&#39;m going to fight him first.<br>-Realizing how bad Charlie is with vibe checks and hearing that he apparently CONGRATULATES A GUY ON SEXUALLY ASSAULTING HIS DAUGHTER, I&#39;m real concerned about the state this county might be in crime wise....<br>-Okay, Charlie might be a terrible father but he is a bicon and I&#39;m here for it.<br>-I&#39;M GONNA KILL THIS MAN.<br>-BELLA, WTF, SNOW IS PRETTY????<br>-It&#39;s a fucking miracle Bella has any friends. No one should like her.<br><del>She has no reason to suspect they&#39;re vampires yet right??? So the get is literally just either Steph forgetting Bella doesn&#39;t know, or Steph going way out of her way to point out &quot;GET GET</del> I DIDN&#39;T SAY EAT SEE???&quot;<br>-lol Allie, setting up an enemies to lovers plot for yourself, I see.<br>-Why he chatting her up if he&#39;s trying to stay tf away from her cause she smells tastey? Like I know he ate since last time, and I know the answer is &quot;Because he&#39;s physically a 17 year old dumbass and this is a cheesy romance novel&quot;, BUT STILL.<br>-Yeah physically being stuck as a teenager doesn&#39;t explain not figuring out in 100 years that including mind reading info in conversation is a no no.<br>-You assume too much of me and my high school to think I&#39;d know and/or remember these phases of cell division.<br><del>OKAY NOW HE&#39;S LITERALLY FLIRTING!! </del><i><del>EDWARD, YOU CAN&#39;T</del></i><i> AAAAAAAAAAH</i><br>-I mean I get going back to high school occasionally, since we&#39;re constantly learning new things about the world and updating curriculums, but like???? Why not go to college like 10 times in between??? You could get at least like 2 doctorates before going back to HS to see what&#39;s new. They could be getting actual knowledge they could use instead of just relearning the same shit every 4 years. Like the them being physically teens thing doesn&#39;t even work, because it&#39;s not like nobody goes through college at 17... There being 5 17 year old freshmen who never talk to anyone seems much stranger than someone starting college a year early or even someone getting their doctorate while looking like a 17 year old.<br>-I just realized, Bella hates non-sunny weather.... She.... She becomes a vampire. Edward knows this. Knows she hates rain and snow and clouds... Knows that&#39;s how they have to live... And really let&#39;s her do that. Oh my goooooooooood.<br>-Good characterization that he&#39;s dumb! Bad continuity that he is later said to not be dumb!<br>-Babe, I&#39;m a grown ass adult and I&#39;d love someone to call me the fuck out like that now, I don&#39;t care that it&#39;s generic drivel. Like, YES, read me, you basic bitch.<br>-Drag Mike, Bella, fucking drag him. No mercy. Don&#39;t dim your shine for people who assume you dull.<br>-&quot;my team ducked out of the way&quot; Since????? When does tennis ever have teams of more than 2??? And why are they in front of her as she&#39;s serving????? And how do several pairs/groups of teens play multiple games of tennis in the gym of a small town HS???? I&#39;m pretty sure they made this volley ball in the movie, which seems to be what Stephanie intended to be writing about unless you misread something. lol But as a writer I could imagine changing which sport they&#39;re playing and forgetting to change everything. I&#39;m confused how no one caught that at any point during the writing or publishing processes though.....<br><del>WHY WOULD HE LAUGH</del> Okay, fine. FINE. I hate this.<br><br>I loved it!

alliebeemac,"You were wondering how long had elapsed between games in the Uncharted series, and in particular (I think) how long from Uncharted 3 to Uncharted 4? At one point I played through the entire remastered series as well as U4, making notes when I found clues. It&#39;s a bit long but here goes:<br>&quot;The backstory for Elena and Nate, between the end of Uncharted one and their encounter in Uncharted 2, can be found in Drake&#39;s U2 journal. Start by looking below Elena&#39;s picture (and the flower) to find &quot;Elena F.  / Papua Jul 2006&quot;, with a presumably fake phone number: (720) 526-192. <br><br>Revelatory details - like other dates and places in Nate&#39;s journal - tell a story: Chloe is on the same journal page as Nate&#39;s other significant others, including a Cassandra S. - obviously not Nate&#39;s mother, who was Cassandra Morgan, but interesting in the light of U4. Looks like Chloe Frazer was in Tulsa in 2002; and she, like all Nate&#39;s girlfriends, had a flower pressed to the page, even though she&#39;s not a flowers and chocolates kind of girl. (Nate, you are such a cad. But Elena had the freshest yellow bloom.)<br><br>People don&#39;t seem to realize it but tracing the entire Uncharted timeline can be done with morsels like that. For example: The last date I found was the wall calendar hanging behind Nathan in Jamieson&#39;s office, at the end of Uncharted 4. It shows that last scene was in November 2015, about when the game was released; and if daughter Cassie is around 12, that places the epilogue of U4 around 2028. (Elena sure had a long-lived Playstation 1, still running with no bit-rot.) Those journals tells all sorts of little stories for those with the patience to look. <br><br>Generally, the games are set in in the year of release. Compare again in Uncharted 2 above where Nate is leafing through his journal - you can see one Nepal visa was issued 29 November 2008 for fifteen days (till 13 December 2008), that he departed 6th December 2008, subsequently went to Indonesia with a visa dated 2009, then wound up again in Nepal at game time in June 2009, that is, 06/09 - as seen on the credit card receipt issued to the Kathmandu medical centre. It mentions AMS and explosive diarrhoea. (Poor Nathan!)",2018-07-14T10:49:00Z

I think trying to see things from Cole&#39;s perspective would explain his actions. Thing is, Okinawa damaged Cole (as well his buddies although to different extent). It&#39;s heavily implied that Cole grew emotionally distant to his wife after the war. As it turns out, he never opened up to her. It&#39;s also worth it to give him a bit of a break for that line. He&#39;s been through the war, he&#39;s come across pedophiles, murderers, rapists. He&#39;s seen the incompetency and the corruption of the LAPD. He&#39;s been in Mason&#39;s bloody catacombs for god&#39;s sake. All of that is guaranteed to make a dent on his mental well-being.",2019-10-27T17:50:04Z

I keep telling people who haven&#39;t played 1 and or 2 to at least be familiar with both their stories or lore because this game references them both for a bit.

alliebeemac,"If you are under impression that Tora was lusting over Poppi for the whole game, that is not true. There&#39;s one cutscene at the beginning that implies he&#39;s into maid outfits (with no assumptions made whether it&#39;s a fetish or he just finds them cute) and a pair of heart-to-hearts which make a lot of people cringe understandably, but their relationship is very tame.<br>I hope you decide to give the game a fair shake at some point, because people tend to overexaggerate how much impact the fanservice actually has on the game.<br>Of course if you feel like the character designs will keep you distracted throughout the game and the very ecistence of Tora is insulting it&#39;s probably best to not push yourself.<br>Best of luck with Xenoblade 3!

JazzyGuns,Here it is guys... we‚Äôve been waiting a long time for this üò≠,2020-06-19T18:36:13Z
JazzyGuns,"This game is a masterpiece. People keep saying Joel deserved better. Did he really?! Joel was never heroic. We rationalized his actions in the first game and created a hero‚Äôs mythology for him because that‚Äôs the nature of video games. That hospital scene at the end of Part 1 was an act of pure evil. No matter how you cut it. That was the moment Joel went from lovable father figure willing to do anything to protect his ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù and the memory of his biological daughter to a villain. And the fact that Ellie reveals in Part 2 that SHE ACTUALLY WANTED TO DIE, makes it even worse. In video games the quest is usually to ‚Äúsave the world‚Äù. In The Last of Us Part 1 we ended up realizing we played as a character who at the end stop the world from being saved in a selfish act (that we admittedly empathized with because we experienced the heartbreak of Joel losing his daughter and the incredible bond he developed with Ellie. That STILL doesn‚Äôt justify what he did. Not only did he murder a slew of innocent people, HE STOPPED THE WORLD FROM BEING SAVED. <br><br>It turned the entire video game medium on its ears. Brilliantly. And words can‚Äôt describe how genius it was for Naughty Dog to give players the ‚Äúchoice‚Äù to shoot the doctor or not at the end. I always thought that was ingenious. Man oh man The Last of Part 2 let‚Äôs us see just how GENIUS it was. Violence begets violence, karma is cyclical, and no good deed goes unpunished. Whether we ‚Äúlike‚Äù it or not Joel had it coming. As does most characters in this shitty world of human depravity where THERE ARE NO HEROES. The amount of emotion Naughty Dog was able to illicit from me with The Last of Us Part 2 is some sort of artistic miracle. Pure magic and serenity turns into pure disgust and hatred in seconds in this universe and they balance that dichotomy beautifully. When I first got control of Abby after she killed Joel I wanted to throw my controller at the TV screen. But one man‚Äôs terrorist is another man‚Äôs freedom fighter. ESPECIALLY in this universe. Who‚Äôs to say Abby‚Äôs revenge wasn‚Äôt just as justified as Joel‚Äôs or Ellie‚Äôs? In a world this bleak, anything goes. The key to making Abby‚Äôs character work was she was actually the FIRST character to realize the destruction her actions was causing and decided to break the cycle. So by the end of the game I loved Abby‚Äôs character and wanted her to find peace just as much as Ellie. The fact that they pulled that off is astonishing. I love her relationship with Owen and the Aquarium sequence was an ingenious set piece that they used to perfection. That being said, they used those moments of serenity against us because the moment they made us have a ‚Äúboss fight‚Äù with Ellie as the villain and forced us to choke her out is one of the most gut-wrenching sequences Ive ever witnessed. In a game of movie. First time in my life I was ‚Äúscared‚Äù to press a button on the controller. I didn‚Äôt want any part of it. AND THATS THE POINT. The Last of Us Part 2 is the greatest deconstruction of violence and it‚Äôs consequences ever made. In any medium. Period.",2020-06-22T02:30:37Z

JazzyGuns,Just started watching but thank you for that intro. This section of the game had me dead .  Love the savage talk,2022-08-02T01:47:19Z
JazzyGuns,"Hey Jazz! Just little tips for you in this game: no need to get the switchboard operator to shut down phones if you only start shooting inside the territory of the enemy. They only call for the police if you start shooting up the streets lol. Also, you need to punch the snitches to stop them because shooting them will only cause more snitches to pop up. Another things is that the dialogue of the three underbosses in the sit-down is affected by who gets assigned to lock down that specific area on the map (one or two people will express interest in the area if you called them to move in on a half of the place). Love watching your videos, always stay safe &lt;3 !",2022-08-03T08:06:21Z

JazzyGuns,"The break up thing isn&#39;t our business however...yall (people in the comments) act like you cant simple answer questions. Clearly Im looking in the live chat and seeing people comment &quot;omg they broke up&quot; So it is 100% okay to ask what happened (as in &quot;why is everyone saying this&quot;)  especially if you are not in the loop on twitter or whatever. Yall making it seem like people are asking why they broke up. They are just asking if it is real. Thats it. Remember for most of us, we found them from their COUPLE channel. The channel that was branded as a COUPLE channel. Why they broke up is not our business I agree. However its not wrong for longtime fans of this COUPLE  to ask if it was a real break up or not. Idk about you but Im subscribed to Dwayne N Jazz and then I found out about JazzyGuns and the Dwayne Kyng Channels.",2020-12-18T02:49:20Z

You and everyone else on the server should write a will so that if you did, you can leave things like your shop and resources to people that are still alive! You could have people complete a quiz or something and get the right to the shop or some of your stuff.

LDShadowLady,"I think the Traps are a good idea but I think you should make it so its easier for you to avoid them.

So if u got wires then whoever goes to admin and does card swipe is the imposter bc it‚Äôs only 1 common task and if he was to have it then u should, u don‚Äôt got it so it‚Äôs him. Another example if u got card swipe and not wires then whoever does wires is the imposter bc u don‚Äôt got that common task and he do. <br>Hope this helpsüëç",2020-11-29T21:01:41Z

stacyplays,some breeding tips i have learned are if you breed a normal unicorn with a destrier pegasus(with the destrier texture)(sycamore) you will get a giant red wing blackbird (there are images on the wings horns and hooves website) and if you breed a normal pegasus(pogonip) with a destrier horse with the hippocampus texture(no tail) ( seaweed but giant) you will get a giant blue belle (also showcased on the wings horns and hooves website) (the blue belle is also available in hippocampus form if you use a giant hippocamp pegasus) hope this helps,2017-08-18T02:46:57Z

Hi guys, this is all for Mystic Mesa!I have a solution for benji, since he can&#39;t walk around without teleporting him you could lead him to a fence! That way he gets his exercise but doesn&#39;t leave home!! Also, make sure you check on all your animals!! Maybe you could have a day where you look for eggs!! Here are some cool names too!! <br>Twilight- it has  to be on a unicorn, then it will change colour!! <br>Dinnerbone- will make any animal go upside down!! <br>jeb_- naming a sheep jeb_ will make them rainbow!!<br>Toast- if you name a bunny toast it turns to this cool texture!!<br>Sorry this was long but please like so Stacy can see!!

I swear the fifty some-odd tabs open in my browser at a time thing has nothing to do with my computer being shiddy. It&#39;s not my fault, I blame Twitch. It handles YT just fine.

Dexbonus,PET ADVICE: Normaly its the cat that has issues with the dog. If your cat is used to being held the best way to get them used to eachother is to hold your cat and pet him while letting him smell the dog. If your cat is too scetchy just hold the dog so it CAN NOT make eye contact with your cat and let the cat smell the dog. You have to do this over and over like perhaps 10 times before your cat will relax. Once the dog is gone give your cat extra love so he knows he did a good job.,2012-12-13T08:31:00Z

Dexbonus,"I know that feel bro, but I have a thing that might make your un-healthy obsession a good thing. Wait a few days, if possible, without watching Dodger&#39;s videos. Then when you have the urge to watch them again or have something that you want/need to do (drawing, homework, work, cleaning) just start up your iPod or phone and listen to the video while you do what you do. I&#39;ve gotten lots done this way. Actually, Dodger, if you read this, thanks! I&#39;ve gotten a lot do thanks to you! :D",2012-11-05T03:59:08Z
Dexbonus,"When I was a young boy, I had an obsession with swiping sticky tack from the stuff hung up on the walls of my elementary school. My addiction got so bad that one time, when my 1st grade teacher went to walk the kids down to the buses (I got picked up), I went in her desk and swiped a chunk of her sticky tack ball. I slowly accumulated sticky tack over the years until I had a ball of my own, the size of my thumb. I still have it. That was about 15 years ago. I guard it with my life.",2012-10-29T19:18:29Z
Dexbonus,"I had much of the same feeling this weekend except it wasn&#39;t for The Goon, but for Sword Art Online. There is just something about fully engrossing one self into a story/setting/world, where when i&#39;m watching the episode or reading exerts; I forget the world i am living in and living all the great moments that are experienced by the characters.

Dexbonus,"If you are on a comic blast, you should definitely check out Locke &amp; Key. Its written by Joe Hill (son of Stephen King) and is epic (if a little dark). 
I got back into comics after using the Comixlogy app on the iPad and using Comics as a tool to entice my son into reading. Once he started reading I started to get back into comics myself and checking out what else was out there. I ended up consuming all there was on Locke and Key within a few days.....its that good!!",2012-10-29T05:50:11Z
Dexbonus,"My cat hates tacks too, i use the sticky tack but i hang smaller lighter pictures and posters, also I agree with your view on The Matrix trilogy. I love the first one, yes the other two are a little cheesy, but it all rounds out and creates a really great story. Unfortunately most people don&#39;t feel this way.",2012-10-29T09:54:31Z
Dexbonus,"Yes! I&#39;m super glad you love &quot;Saga&quot; because it&#39;s my favourite series right now. You should check out the seventh issue when it comes out in November (I think it&#39;s the second Wednesday it comes out?). You should also check out &quot;The Manhattan Projects&quot; vol. 1 by Jonathan Hickman and Nick Pitarra as well as &quot;American Vampire&quot; by Scott Snyder and Raf Albuquerque. You also might like the newest &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; series by Marvel with Carol Danvers as CM, it&#39;s been pretty badass so far. All the comics!",2012-10-29T08:26:44Z

Dexbonus,So I was browsing reddit and saw this particular thread teaching a very valuable lesson on how to do a loud whistle. Sure I can do the gentle melodic whistle along with Axl when listening to Patience but if I ever need to step up my game and get the attention of a ragtag group of survivors in a zombie apocalypse I&#39;d need the skill to do so. Then twitter updated and I saw I wasn&#39;t the only one covered in spit. I hope at least one of us learned something new today...,2012-10-29T03:35:09Z

Dexbonus,"Hey Dodge, i am a huge comicbook nerd. i read A LOT of stuff.

if you were interested, i would highly recommend checking out Rick Remenders Uncanny XForce from Marvel. In my opinion its been the best Marvel series this past year. but to help sell you on it, wolverine and deadpool are on the team with a few other peeps, it&#39;s killer.

Also the new Hawkeye series has been really amazing. Reads a lot like an indie book rather than a super hero. the art is very 70&#39;s pop art style",2012-10-29T05:37:53Z

Sqaishey Quack,Hey,2022-09-22T17:05:16Z
Sqaishey Quack,"Great video Sqaishey! I love the idea if turning the mob spawner into a tree, it will fit in a lot more. Just a suggestion, but I think sometimes things look better unsymmetrical, just because most naturally slawned things aren&#39;t. But nevertheless it still looks great. The squids are loving your water, maybe they want to be added to the Feather Friends ping. Or maybe they are stealing your pumpkin pie! Also for the Things For Today chest I recommend putting double what you think you need in, so if you do want to build anything extra you have the right amount of materials to do so.  Sometimes when playing in survival I wish I could fly, its so annoying having to build platforms, its like leaving a trail of dirt behind me üòÇ Also, is your server going to open again anytime soon? I miss playing on it, even if it can get quite hectic at times. Anyway as I said before, great video Sqaishey. Thanks for uploading!",2015-05-02T21:50:36Z

Sqaishey Quack,"Sqaishey, tip when crafting. Hold right click and drag to put one of the item in the spaces you drag over. Hold left click and drag to put equal amounts in slots you drag over. This also works for chests and your inventory. To put all stacks of cobble or whatever into a chest, double click the stack/item to put all stacks in chest. Works vice-versa.<br>Hope this helps you Sqaishey!",2015-05-02T12:54:29Z

KittyKatGaming,Digoxin is often used in the er and icu. It slows down heart contractions but also increases pump strength and volume. Giving snake dig allowed for his blood pressure to be high enough for him to stand up in the beginning of the game.,2015-10-29T17:56:39Z

KittyKatGaming,"One time on the first mission, I had this guard in a headlock and I was getting clues. When I was done I accidentally let him go, so I panicked and pressed random buttons, and snake grabbed the guy, lifted him up in the air by his head, and slam dunked his head into the concrete, leaving cracks from the impact.

KittyKatGaming,"Fun fact: Digoxin is used to treat certain heart conditions. It would have slowed Ahab&#39;s heart rate and killed him due to the fact that his heart was already weak from being in a nine year long coma. Therefore, it was probably something more along the lines of adrenaline mixed with steroids to help his muscles.",2017-07-12T07:11:15Z

Its permanent suppressor is only accessible at level 6, and earlier versions without it heavily resemble the AMT Auto Mag Pistol with the addition of a polymer frame. The gun is the equivalent of the XM9 from MGS2, Mk.22 Mod 0 featured in MGS3, Portable Ops &amp; Peace Walker, and the Ruger Mk. II from MGS4, and as in those games is manually operated.

KittyKatGaming,these intros are just the best,2015-10-29T17:17:02Z
KittyKatGaming,"I wish arin would make his own show based on his parody of kaz and Ocelot. Those are my favorite parts of this playthrough and Suzy&#39;s gay side story adds to it. I mean, rick and Morty is based off of Justin Roiland&#39;s extreme parody of back to the future, jsut imagine if Arin made a parody of Metal Gear Awesome that only sort of paid homage to the game but used his parodies of big boss, kaz and ocelot from this playthrough. I can already see him doing another version of &quot;It&#39;s Dangerous To Go Alone&quot; with Kaz trying to solicit big boss for sex through music. I&#39;d pay to see that on Adult Swim.",2015-10-30T04:12:14Z

So I try to figure it out by putting names to the pictures as they show up. Then Ross didn&#39;t do one, it confused me even more. 2 or 3 minutes later I confirmed that he wasn&#39;t there.",2017-01-13T08:45:00Z

KittyKatGaming,I believe taking Mercy‚Äôs invulnerability will using rez was a mistake. It‚Äôs definitely a lot harder to keep your team active and competitive in the heat of battle because of it and it can get a bit disheartening if you‚Äôre unable to help your team as a support hero. :( I hope Blizzard either gives back her invulnerability or creates something that can even everything out a little more..,2017-09-28T18:30:08Z

I&#39;m surprised that Noway joined up so easily. I gave him his favorite food, ramen, several times and he would not join up. Once you do get Noway he is useful.

This is Rich Frankie&#39;s first indie title, he is not a fulltime drag queen, but Kitty Powers is &#39;a part of him&#39;.<br>Here is an article with more info:<br><br><a href=""http://www.polygon.com/features/2015/4/29/8511077/kitty-powers-interview"">http://www.polygon.com/features/2015/4/29/8511077/kitty-powers-interview</a>",2015-07-14T00:32:54Z
KittyKatGaming,Rainy weather is awesome. It beats the heat during the summer.,2015-07-13T17:52:29Z
KittyKatGaming,Genevieve is pretty much how someone from England would speak. True story.,2015-07-14T05:39:07Z
KittyKatGaming,aaa suzy is so sweet and open minded,2016-07-14T23:44:48Z
KittyKatGaming,The Salon is so you can give them their date&#39;s preferences in hair color and such.,2015-07-13T17:52:59Z
KittyKatGaming,"Suzy<br>Good GOD Suzy<br>While it is weird to change your look before a date in REAL life, this is a GAME.<br>Change the look of your client to match the dates preferences, it&#39;s just more helpful.",2015-07-13T23:56:53Z
KittyKatGaming,"Rainy weather is quite lovely, I agree. It helps me sleep. C:",2015-07-17T05:07:15Z

KittyKatGaming,"WHOA, What is this playlist order?!?!<br><br>the parts go 7-3-4-1-9-8-6-2-5-10<br><br>Am I insane, or out of some loop here?",2015-08-06T18:05:43Z
KittyKatGaming,This game doesn&#39;t take itself seriously at all. The salon isn&#39;t a complex social commentary about changing who you are to make others happy. It&#39;s a game mechanic you can use so their hair color matches their date&#39;s preference to grab some bonus points.,2015-07-13T21:38:41Z
KittyKatGaming,OH MY GOD SUZY SAID MY NAME HOLY SHIT<br>THAT HAS MADE MY FUCKING DAY EVEN THOUGH IT WASN&#39;T DIRECTED AT ME AT ALL OMFG,2016-12-27T12:48:02Z

KittyKatGaming,A dogsbody is like a servant&#39;s servant.,2015-07-13T18:54:58Z
KittyKatGaming,I don&#39;t think Tobias and Malachi should be paired. It should be Tobias and Tony because they both like/have green eyes.,2015-07-13T20:49:13Z

KittyKatGaming,"Britain, you need to import more food from countries you HAVEN&#39;T colonized. You&#39;ve got plenty of Indian restaurants, so that&#39;s a good start; now go further east. There is more to Asian cooking than just what you can get at Yo!Sushi (although Yo!Sushi is pretty good).",2015-07-22T14:18:01Z

KittyKatGaming,You change your hair color so they match what they like.,2015-07-13T20:57:11Z

KittyKatGaming,first comment,2015-07-13T17:03:05Z
KittyKatGaming,"Hi, Suzy! Brigitte&#39;s super cute dance is based on a victory dance done by the Swedish Women&#39;s National Handball (?) team but the original version has more...erm, booty work. They basically toned it down for yah gurl but it&#39;s not a real problem because it&#39;s the cutest dance, if you ask me.<br><br>Also...! Mei&#39;s dance is a part of the &quot;Hare Hare Yukai&quot; from one of endings to the anime Haruhi Suzumiya no Yuutsu.",2018-05-31T20:01:34Z
KittyKatGaming,"I think Bastion&#39;s new voice line sounds like &quot;exterminate&quot;, like the daleks from Doctor Who!",2018-05-31T18:16:27Z
KittyKatGaming,"Love your event videos! My Orisa main heart is melting over her new skin, it‚Äôs so CUTE üòç",2018-05-31T18:57:00Z
KittyKatGaming,Moira&#39;s dance looks better with sleeves,2018-05-31T18:52:43Z
KittyKatGaming,"The description in McCree&#39;s Sherlock skin is from The Sign of the Four, when Sherlock is explaining that he uses drugs because he gets bored. It almost doesn&#39;t need mentioning, but Moira&#39;s second new voice line (&quot;This was a triumph&quot;) is a Portal reference! And a couple of Star Wars references from Doomfist, Orisa, and Pharah&#39;s lines.",2018-05-31T20:01:24Z
KittyKatGaming,"Love the video, and your channel! Its always exciting to see a notification that you uploaded &lt;3",2018-05-31T18:32:35Z
KittyKatGaming,"Suzi is so pure :,)",2018-06-02T18:34:32Z
KittyKatGaming,I seem to be the only one who loves the new Tracer skin. Tracer always had a quantity over quality problem so I&#39;m happy that my main has a skin that I love.,2018-05-31T21:25:01Z
KittyKatGaming,All skins from past events are available for purchase! You can buy the Hanzo one,2018-05-31T18:18:06Z
KittyKatGaming,Bastion and Soldier‚Äôs new skins look even more like Bionicles than their winter ones,2018-05-31T23:53:30Z
KittyKatGaming,So glad Doomfist is getting more love &lt;3 my man! I definitely want a football doomfist skin someday,2018-05-31T21:51:47Z
KittyKatGaming,"Sym&#39;s Magician skin is the one that really stood out for me, but then i saw Briggete&#39;s and i definitely need that one too! (and i don&#39;t even play her... yet lol)",2018-05-31T21:28:30Z
KittyKatGaming,"You can hit next at the bottom of the skin to see their weapons, so you could&#39;ve shown symmetra&#39;s turret",2018-05-31T19:36:22Z
KittyKatGaming,bastion is def singing here comes the bride. first bastion skin i‚Äôve understood immediately ahaha. also you can get the scion skin bc they‚Äôre all unlockable for this event.,2018-06-01T00:59:40Z
KittyKatGaming,I still need to get the Brigitte skin but I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôve gotten the new Symmetra and Orisa skins so far.,2018-05-31T18:39:57Z
KittyKatGaming,"Pharah-syndrome = when it feels like a hero hasn&#39;t got new skins for a while (you know, beside ASP and Qinglong) or has never enough new skins regardless of the actual reality. Reason: projecting other things to this feeling, like the lack of an animated short (she has a comic though), or sticking to the past when the hero didn&#39;t get skins as often as some of the more popular ones (while still getting more stuff than some of the others). <br><br>Tracer-syndrome = when it feels like a hero always gets new skins (or has more skins than anyone else) regardless of the actual reality. Reason: overexposure and temporary peaks of the hero&#39;s skin-releases (notice: her last event-legendary was actually Graffiti from Anniversary 2017).<br><br>Invisible Mei-syndrome = when people don&#39;t complain or notice hero&#39;s unbalanced and excessive supply in terms of cosmetic updates (has more legendary-skins than Tracer) or game modes (has 2 own festive game modes based around her), or other content like comics or animated shorts. Reason: Mei is bae (and constantly off-meta and has a low pick-rate making her invisible but mostly because Mei is bae)",2018-06-01T06:41:20Z
KittyKatGaming,Could Moira&#39;s &quot;This is a triumph&quot; voice line be a possible reference to Portal? GlaDos says that in the ending song &quot;Still Alive&quot;,2018-05-31T19:57:22Z
KittyKatGaming,"I feel like, they should add a &quot;mech&quot; &quot;no mech&quot; option to dva&#39;s emotes.",2018-06-01T16:44:07Z
KittyKatGaming,Definitely 2nd year. I remember everyone being excited for it to come out in 2016 when I was working for Google,2018-06-01T04:05:14Z

KittyKatGaming,"I got the Brigette legendary anniversary skin in a loot box, so lucky!!",2018-06-01T02:53:59Z
KittyKatGaming,I was just disappointed with Moira&#39;s dance because they missed a perfect opportunity to give her an Irish dance and a matching skin. How awesome would that have been?,2018-05-31T20:40:10Z
KittyKatGaming,That mccree quote is directly from a Sherlock Holmes story!!,2018-05-31T19:57:07Z

KittyKatGaming,Great video as always~!!! &lt;3 Just fyi! The Mei dance is from the Anime The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya! From the ending Hare Hare Yukai~! Not k-pop~ ;3,2018-05-31T19:09:21Z
KittyKatGaming,The orisa skin was my fav til I realized everyone to ever play orisa again was gonna use it.,2018-05-31T19:34:46Z
KittyKatGaming,Also you can buy any item from any event for the anniversary,2018-05-31T18:53:35Z
KittyKatGaming,You know Pharah got a skin from the rooster event right?,2018-05-31T22:23:29Z
KittyKatGaming,I believe that the best skin for symmetra would be removing her entirely.,2018-05-31T19:55:39Z
KittyKatGaming,Moira&#39;s dance could have been Irish step dancing...,2018-05-31T21:46:32Z
KittyKatGaming,or a vikings vs pirate level. attacking side is pirate themed defense is vikings.,2018-05-31T21:03:51Z
KittyKatGaming,Doomfist had the best skin in my opinion,2018-06-01T02:15:39Z
KittyKatGaming,Mei‚Äôs dance is actually from an old anime,2018-06-01T04:33:25Z
KittyKatGaming,I may be cofused but you did get the scion outfit for hanzo in your last unboxing video,2018-07-02T06:54:48Z
KittyKatGaming,Brigitte&#39;s skin should&#39;ve been called Bear-gitte,2018-05-31T18:49:10Z
KittyKatGaming,I think symmetra&#39;s skin is a reference to zatanna.,2018-05-31T20:38:06Z
KittyKatGaming,&quot;Which sounds vaguely sexual.&quot;<br><br>Suzy 2018,2018-06-01T17:50:10Z

KittyKatGaming,Blizzard needs to chill its only been two years.,2018-05-31T23:57:58Z
KittyKatGaming,"I‚Äôm sure you have been spammed like crazy about this already, but I don‚Äôt want to read through comments. You can get ANY skin from ANY event in this anniversary event.

KittyKatGaming,I JUST GOT A OVERWATCH ANNIVERSARY AD WTF,2018-05-31T18:29:38Z
KittyKatGaming,its second year,2018-06-02T20:20:59Z
KittyKatGaming,I&#39;m really glad this game exists... I&#39;m studying nursing and I&#39;ve never had myself a panic attack so this  helps me to understand a little how those people feel when having crisis and how I can help them better. <del>i hope this makes sense because i&#39;m not a english native speaker</del>,2015-11-12T18:27:45Z
KittyKatGaming,As someone who suffers from severe social anxiety and panic disorder I can say that this is nothing like the real deal and I didn&#39;t get &quot;triggered&quot; at all. But I&#39;m very glad someone out there is trying to raise awareness for mental disorders :),2015-11-12T19:08:32Z
KittyKatGaming,I&#39;d just like to thank you for the trigger warning. Thanks for being considerate.,2015-11-12T23:12:17Z
KittyKatGaming,"Thanks for the warning; I decided to watch anyway cause of curiosity, but it&#39;s nice of you to put a warning there. I&#39;m really glad that games like this exist; it means a lot to have them try to explore mental conditions, and this one did make me feel kind of uneasy, I have to say. The flashing of negative worries is good detail, and that&#39;s something that I can definitely notice with anxiety.",2015-11-13T03:50:50Z
KittyKatGaming,"I feel like this kinda made panic attacks seem more annoying than debilitating, but the flooding of negative thoughts was somewhat accurate to mine, and the inability to move. <br><br>On a separate note, I though an interesting idea would be to have a game like this that involved interacting with another person, with things like giving you the ability to type a response to them, but whenever you type a letter it has like a 5 second lag.",2015-11-12T18:24:28Z
KittyKatGaming,"I didn&#39;t think this would bother me but my breathing started to match the breathing in the game and I started to tense up and had to stop watching it. I&#39;ve been having anxiety attacks constantly this week and this really works. Probably not on everyone, but I&#39;m definitely going to show this to my friends so they can kinda understand it better.",2015-11-13T07:31:41Z
KittyKatGaming,"This was an interesting game. Anxiety attacks range in symptoms--anything from lightly stuttered breathing to upchucking your lunch--so I&#39;m not sure it really managed to touch on all of the experiences people with anxiety have. (Being able to replicate the unfocused frustration and aching of shoulders/neck that I personally feel might be a little more difficult to replicate in game form.) Regardless, I think it provides a nice, safe glimpse into the terrible experience for people who have never felt an attack before. It&#39;s an ambitious goal to be able to capture an altered mental state in a piece of media so kudos to the creator for having the balls to try.",2015-11-13T18:40:14Z
KittyKatGaming,Suzy needs to watch the Mega Man X Sequelitis and listen to Arin&#39;s explanation of &quot;conveyance&quot;.,2015-11-12T18:33:42Z
KittyKatGaming,thank you for playing this suzy &lt;3,2015-11-12T19:23:03Z
KittyKatGaming,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IEe7Y55SFE&amp;t=13m34s"">13:34</a> &quot;Or if it&#39;s triggered by us not doing breathing enough&quot; <br>Yes Suzy exactly this. You keep stopping the breathing when everything is still blurry. The beginning clearly said &quot;It is important to breathe correctly to stay calm.&quot;",2015-11-13T06:41:50Z
KittyKatGaming,"For those of you who are complaining that this game is boring or that it blows because this isn&#39;t how you experience anxiety or panic attacks, you have to remember that every person experiences anxiety differently. If you remember from the very beginning of the game, the creator said that they wanted to share <b>their</b> experience with others. Just because it&#39;s not what <b>you</b> experience doesn&#39;t mean that this simulation or the way that the creator experiences anxiety isn&#39;t valid.<br><br>I thought it was a decent simulation, especially since it really can be that hard to focus on your breathing while walking or doing anything else that is supposed to be &quot;natural&quot; for a person to do. This game can also help raise awareness about anxiety and panic attacks by showing just how serious they are and how they can impact a person&#39;s day-to-day life.",2015-11-13T21:22:16Z
KittyKatGaming,thank you for including the warnings suzy,2015-11-12T19:04:49Z
KittyKatGaming,"I think part of the controls being bad is on purpose, it&#39;s hard to work towards your objective while concentrating on your breathing. That said, I agree that this doesn&#39;t really mirror a panic attack well, but I can&#39;t think of anything better to do so though. My personal experience now that I&#39;ve grown a lot as a person and left a lot of my self loathing behind is that I will get an intense FEAR with an intense desire to  go somewhere safer, but the worst part to me is that there is no source for the fear, everything is normal and safe and I&#39;m terrified.",2017-04-12T03:23:22Z
KittyKatGaming,You have to keep breathing as you walk. You can go quite a long while without having the attack if you breathe properly. You gotta make sure you get the blue oval bursting out when you breathe to show you&#39;re doing it right.,2015-11-12T19:56:30Z
KittyKatGaming,I like the concept and that it&#39;s about raising awareness but the experience isn&#39;t really that close to real life.  I&#39;d be interested in seeing the concept fleshed out some more.,2015-11-13T17:28:05Z
