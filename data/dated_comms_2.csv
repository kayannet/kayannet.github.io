MrBeast Gaming,"When you realize even after the $10,000 tip the $16,000 build still costs more 💀",2023-06-21T07:12:19Z
MrBeast Gaming,"I love how the 16,000 dollar build still earned more money than the winner 💀",2023-04-28T03:05:27Z
MrBeast Gaming,"tbh the 100$ build deserved to win, its easily the best bang for your buck. the 5k one is very cool and all but thats 5 grand, literally 50x more expensive than the 100$ one. personally dont know if i would say its 50x better but thats just me",2023-07-12T18:44:47Z
MrBeast Gaming,You guys gotta remember. He stilled paid the last build 16k which is more than the prize money. The 5k base that won still got less money than the 16k build.,2021-12-02T16:51:00Z
MrBeast Gaming,"I love how the builders of the $16,000 build still got more money than the winners",2022-04-21T17:03:43Z
MrBeast Gaming,really good of you to fund these builders creativity and you can tell by the wide variety of builds that you didn&#39;t provide too much instruction and let them follow their hearts,2023-06-03T23:53:12Z
MrBeast Gaming,Jimmy never disappoints,2023-08-09T19:14:22Z
MrBeast Gaming,Imagine if the $5000 builders got to work for the $16000. The build would&#39;ve been hella crazy.,2022-04-24T16:58:53Z
MrBeast Gaming,His builds are really awesome,2023-07-19T14:08:27Z
MrBeast Gaming,"the builds themselves are still very impressive. however, i’d like to point out that the majority of terrains are probably created using external software and certain aspects are edited afterwards in game. it still takes an absurd amount of time, though and is very impressive.",2021-09-04T15:35:32Z
MrBeast Gaming,I just realized that the last build still ended up making more money than the one that won,2022-08-11T18:44:38Z
MrBeast Gaming,i like how after $50 they were no longer a singular house lol,2022-12-28T00:08:20Z
MrBeast Gaming,Ya estoy suscrito 😊,2023-08-03T22:25:34Z
MrBeast Gaming,This video came out before I started playing minecraft and even I could tell that these builds were so hard to build.,2022-07-06T14:56:11Z
MrBeast Gaming,Quiero concursar en esto de construcción así sea de 5 dólares,2023-07-08T23:08:32Z
MrBeast Gaming,Mr. Beasts minecraft house cost more than my irl house,2021-08-25T20:15:21Z
MrBeast Gaming,Mine from the surface might be called a 5 dollar home. But once you go underground you will see something insane. So insane that even the server owner loves it.,2022-12-19T02:11:28Z
MrBeast Gaming,The team who built the $16k Minecraft World got more money that the actual winners.,2022-06-11T13:31:02Z
MrBeast Gaming,Kapan ke Indonesia mr.beast? Hehe,2023-07-13T09:13:48Z
MrBeast Gaming,The fact that even if they payed the 5k build 10k the total amount the 5k build got would still be less than the 16k build,2023-01-09T09:06:01Z
MrBeast Gaming,Wow such a wonderful content and inspiration for begginers❤,2023-07-27T02:55:12Z
MrBeast Gaming,"Even though the $5000 build won 10 grand, the $16 grand one still got more money",2023-06-05T18:40:27Z
MrBeast Gaming,"I reckon that if they payed 5000 thousand dollars to the guy that built the  100 dollar house, it would be a masterpiece",2022-03-31T02:17:07Z
MrBeast Gaming,I guess our mr.beast brother and his team don&#39;t understand the structures. 😅,2023-06-23T14:04:31Z
MrBeast Gaming,"This creator is genius. He starts at the lowest cost and builds up anticipation for the big one. His retention efforts are far above par of any other creator I’ve watched. I’ve never been bored of his videos. He knows when have the highs, and knows exactly when to have a lull. Jimmy, you are truly one of s kind!",2022-04-05T23:10:26Z
MrBeast Gaming,"Bro paid the 16000 dollar guy more than the 5,000 dollar one that won 💀💀",2023-07-22T04:40:52Z
MrBeast Gaming,Yeah the last one looked like more of an art piece rather than a base/home. The 5k one was more on point as well as just overall more aesthetically pleasing.,2021-12-03T10:56:54Z
MrBeast Gaming,I wish we were told the builders for these. I would love to commission something,2022-07-05T02:05:34Z

MrBeast Gaming,개지린다 너무 잘만듬 16000달러지린다,2023-08-02T05:01:04Z
MrBeast Gaming,"Out of the two contenders for winning, I’m glad that one won. It was just way more cohesive and realistic, and just had a nice location vibe rather than a bunch of big characters. Not to say the other one was bad, it was good, but idk, that’s a bit too pricey for that imo.",2021-08-25T19:52:10Z
MrBeast Gaming,"5k feels a lot more personal and super cool with the furnishing and credits, but the 16k was incredibly detailed with the superheroes and must have taken lots of effort. i have to say karl was right by everything he said.",2022-08-06T16:30:28Z
MrBeast Gaming,Even Karl didn’t believe sepnaps  rating for the 1600£  build when he gave it only an 8,2022-05-16T21:12:36Z
MrBeast Gaming,Oi Jimmy sou do Brasil <br>Queria competir em um desafio seu,2023-07-25T00:27:15Z
MrBeast Gaming,Jimmy always has the craziest video ideas,2022-04-13T22:15:49Z
MrBeast Gaming,"The 5,000 dollar one is so good in my opinion. The fact that every building has furniture and they actually credited all the builders in the build is so respectful<br>y",2023-06-21T22:46:07Z
MrBeast Gaming,"I like the 5k one more based on setting preference. The 16k has sculptures which are incredibly difficult, and there are a lot of details added for things like fire and smoke, but a lot of the buildings end up being fairly simple in design as far as &quot;tall rectangle building&quot; goes. It also just feels like a less playable world and more just show-and-tell (which is fine because it was the point of the video).<br><br>The 5k just seems more fun to play in for me.",2022-03-08T21:43:47Z
MrBeast Gaming,The 5000 Build had more practical use in my opinion<br>You could play survival on it,2022-06-25T12:11:27Z
MrBeast Gaming,Jimmy I never played Minecraft but you made me download it cause I love how people do these competitions I can only imagine the hours it takes to make these so detailed,2023-04-20T22:00:42Z

Markiplier,"Hi Mark <br><br>I found this one game on Steam that is like really interesting. You play as a government agent that uses a new software program that monitors everything. You spend time profiling people related to a bombing. The story line is very twisty and has multiple endings. It&#39;s called Orwell. I&#39;ve put about 20 hours into it since the story is ungodly suspenseful...<br><br>Just thought I&#39;d pass on the idea... Have a good one, mate.",2018-04-05T04:56:54Z

Markiplier,His reaction to the dubstep mode in grass simulator was the funniest thing ever  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂,2020-12-31T13:25:00Z
Markiplier,"&quot;What if I just harvest all their shit?&quot;<br>Don&#39;t joke Mark. That happened to me. I brought in my beautiful CUSTOM BUILT state of the art gaming computer for a VIRUS. Took them 2 weeks to remove the virus and when I plugged it in, it didn&#39;t power on. They told me it shorted out at home (It didn&#39;t) And I didn&#39;t want to bring it back but they said they&#39;d wave the labor fee. So they put in a new power source but take another week. My dad, trying to be helpful, calls them up to check on the computer and they say the motherboard needs to be replaced. Now, by now, I had already decided that the moment I got it back they were never touching it again. but my dad, who pretends to be genial and thinks he can make everyone like him tells them to go ahead and replace it (I try not to get mad at my parents but boy did I give him a talking to...okay a yelling to). I FINALLY get it back. It has a USED power supply/source, a YELLOW substandard motherboard AND when i turn it on...graphics card doesn&#39;t work. <br>It&#39;s been a paperweight for about 8 years because I just shut down when I think about it and can&#39;t bring myself to try and fix it. I Spent most of my adult life so far (I am 31) Completely destitute. I didn&#39;t have money to fix the damage they did.<br><br>I don&#39;t think anyone will read this whole thing but this is the abridged version. The place closed down after I wrote some scathing reviews on like...three different sites. I went to check my reviews a year or so after writing them...&quot;someone&quot; had RE-WRITTEN 5 star reviews from 2008 (it was 2011 at the time) so that the old reviews would look new and have the 2011 date on them. Ridiculous. So yeah..BEAUTIFUL gaming computer reduced to an over sized paperweight in a month....I brought it in for a VIRUS.",2018-04-05T10:33:59Z

But my philosophy has always been the same in that I believe people watch my videos not to see me succeed, but to see me struggle and then succeed.",2012-09-10T15:23:31Z

Markiplier,"If it&#39;s any consolation, I actually enjoy watching you work out problems and discover solutions. I&#39;m watching it for your input as much as I am for the game experience. Don&#39;t start slashing bit&#39;s out because it would feel too false. Plus, I&#39;ve never watched the reaction compilations; because what interests me is what you actually do. Been watching for a few hours now, definitely got a sub!

Keep it up. Found a lot of games I want to play through your videos.
Lots of lurve,

Markiplier,"Sir, i have seen countless playthroughs of games, not just of horror but in general. and it is a MOST welcome change, in how you do things. its nice to see your face, your reactions, and how not all gamers on youtube are dead when it comes to jump scares. you have a brand new subscriber and i look forward to seeing all your old content, especially deadspace. keep doing what you do!",2012-09-12T00:29:47Z

Markiplier,"@randompersonB I`ve been watching Marks ,,Lets Plays&quot; for about a month or so. During this time I was scared just as often as he was, I was confused about certain things, again, just like he was, and I also thought about ways of solving the problems that came up. So yeah, I can say that I enjoy his episodes exactly the way they are. I don`t care if they last 48 mins ( like Drunk-Minecraft) or 15 mins ( like most of his other series) , I`m going to watch them. PS: Sorry if my english sucks :).",2012-09-10T21:14:08Z
Markiplier,Best reason to watch Markiplier is because he never gets boring :D,2012-09-10T17:18:41Z
Markiplier,"Not suggesting Markiplier is perfect by the way, simply saying I personally don&#39;t mind the odd occasion when he gets stuck. Possibly because I&#39;ve been in similar situations and enjoy seeing the same feeling in him when he succeeds that I feel when I do after a long stint of stuckness. That&#39;s kind of part of the charm here. ",2012-09-10T17:04:50Z

Markiplier,"Mark, could you update your playlist when you upload multiple videos of the same series?

",2012-09-13T03:57:38Z
Markiplier,"Honestly I think that he didn&#39;t get lost very long at all in this episode. There are videos where he can&#39;t figure out something from start to finish, this one it only took Mark... five minutes at the most to notice the numbers? I agree that it could lose viewers, and I have skipped through some of his content where he&#39;s been lost, but I recall him skipping through the first part of Anna (I think) and being annoyed by it. So I prefer it being raw and unedited.",2012-09-10T16:41:36Z

Markiplier,"Half the time I&#39;m just banging my head on that adrenaline-rush music. Not a big fan of dubstep or whatever, but can&#39;t deny how epic the BGM is! Also reminds me of the time you played Attack on Titan the game for some reason, except with less getting punched in the face by naked ballerina Titans and more acid-trip gunslinging.",2014-06-11T17:05:52Z

Markiplier,"Gentlemen, our mission is simple: Get this video to Markiplier&#39;s third most-viewed video so the MEOW-WOOF-MOO Trilogy can reign supreme.<br><br><b>Update (5 March 2023):</b> MEOW-WOOF-MOO!! On this day, we shall surpass FNAF!! On this day, MEOW-WOOF-MOO reigns supreme (for a few minutes, take those screenshots while you can). Never give up the fight, as our FNAF foe will be forever lurking in our shadow. But thank you to everyone who committed time and effort to completing this ridiculous goal! You all are awesome! Go in peace, now, and fulfill other important missions throughout this year! <br><br>Update (11 January 2023): On the cusp of completing our mission, gang, we must remain vigilant! For even if we reach the coveted goal of 106 Million Views, we must push to 107 to truly surpass FNAF! I know I am asking much from all of you, for many of you have been fighting so hard, and we all truly appreciate it, but we must not stop! <br><br>One excellent way to push this video through the YouTube algorithm is to watch it at 0.25x speed (maybe just once or twice if we all do it, then back to normal speed), this will tell YouTube that lots of people are spending a loooong time on the video, and YouTube will begin to recommend it to lots more people. <br><br>Keep up the fight, and thank you to all of you for your contributions to this goal!

Markiplier,"I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q3YDezqcM&amp;t=1m12s"">1:12</a>. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q3YDezqcM&amp;t=6m34s"">6:34</a> that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don&#39;t think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it&#39;s great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I&#39;m struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q3YDezqcM&amp;t=57m42s"">57:42</a>.I am currently crying so hard right now.

The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Q3YDezqcM&amp;t=2m10s"">2:10</a>.

jacksepticeye,"<b>SOME IMPORTANT TIPS FOR YOU JACK</b><br><br>- To make a functional ship you need to craft an atlas sky core and place it on the ship to make it float, you need to place sails on it to go forward (you unlock the skill to craft engines later on) and you need to place a helm on it to steer, ascend and descend.<br>- Try not to shoot at people for no reason. It&#39;s considered a pretty large dick move in this game and people will tend to hunt you down<br>- Just scan everything to gain knowledge. Knowledge is used to level up your crafting skills for better ship parts such as engines.<br>- It&#39;s an unwritten rule to ask permission to board another players ship. If people get surprised by you boarding they may think you are a pirate and kill you. (Yes, piracy is a thing in this game)<br>- <b>Very important</b> When you built a ship, place a personal reviver on it and register yourself to it by holding E. If you die you will respawn on your ship and not on a random island.<br>- When you open your inventory you have a smaller inventory space below your main inventory called &quot;belt separator&quot;. Every item you place there keeps saved upon death. Place your gun and ammo there so you don&#39;t lose it everytime you die.<br><br>Hope this was helpfull :3",2017-06-06T17:20:12Z

jacksepticeye,Jack. I have a few tips: 1. Eat berries they restore health over time. 2. There should be a kind of crafting station near the shipyard. And now a very short story on how to build a ship: you need a steering wheel. You need that atlas thing and you need sails. That&#39;s all. Oh AND DO NOT DARE TO GO THROUGH THE WIND WALLS YOU SEE YOU CAN ONLY GO TROUGH WHEN YOU HAVE AN TIER 1 Engine! And be less aggressive. Only attack when they&#39;re too close to your chests or you see them grieving. You would not live long without a trusty friend... aaand this comment is way to long so hope you&#39;ll read this.,2017-06-06T17:16:53Z

Dream,"This project looks amazing, and it’s sad it was shelved for the moment. I would like to suggest a way to take it off the shelf (even if it’s unlikely for this to be seen.)<br>Start the server with three distinct language groups, one English and the others in two different Asian languages ( to not overlap with the QSMP’s current ones).<br>Make the goal of the USMP unity. Give the groups each “land” and give tasks where they work for “world” peace. Let the builders build, the role players role play, and have PvP for PvPers. See if they can actually achieve peace and maintain it. <br>Have competitions for more land or resources and see what happens. Building competitions. PvP competitions. And let alliances be things that can form between groups for the roleplayers to shine by making stories through that. Maybe even “bribing” judges from other “countries.”<br>It would be fun for people to watch, unique, and very different to what is happening on other servers since it is more structured and parallels fun things like Skywars and MCC but with possible rp twists and turns.<br>Add groups as things get stale and see how long before it dissolves into madness for the players. Can world peace be achieved with groups from everywhere on earth?<br>It’s just an idea, but I’d watch.",2023-06-06T05:23:20Z

Dream,Their team work is immaculate. They definitely deserve the title dream team!,2022-08-22T13:48:38Z
Dream,I would love Dream team to try this again. Just paying more attention to saturation next time; not jumping around as much on the early levels and instead conserving their hunger when they don&#39;t need the crits as much. Or maybe try it again but with Bad and Ant there too. Could be a cool series and I&#39;d love to see it again!!,2023-04-19T04:08:41Z

Dream,"I think having the floors get crazier but having infinite food would be good, or maybe something like +1 steak every floor to make it more fair.

DanTDM,"Oh wow, it&#39;s so funny to watch someone play neopets if they didn&#39;t grow up playing it. I guess I can see how frustrating it is since it&#39;s not as easy to navigate as games today. But honestly there are so many things he was making harder then they have to be. <br>I wish the site would update though, it&#39;s getting very out dated.",2017-07-28T02:52:47Z
DanTDM,Future Dan: &quot; Ah! The nostalgia..... he&#39;s still for kids,2020-07-14T10:02:47Z
DanTDM,"POSSIBLY ANYONE who reads this will either think I&#39;m crazy AND/OR scream their head off (I know I did (both I might add)), but the neopet that Dan adopted that was 13 years old, I got once. I actually got it in &quot;2007/2008&quot;. The ONLY reason that I put it back up for adoption was because it had the sneeezles and I couldn&#39;t afford the cure. I mean, come on, how does it still have that AND was still up for adoption?! I mean wow, just wow!",2017-02-14T20:17:54Z

DanTDM,Dan the Shadow Lord is not the hardest boss. Look up Graw and the Primordal five Also here is some tips to go to new dimensions. Lands of Lelyetia: Go to the Haven and repeatedly kill seekers. Ancient Cavern: Go to the Haven and repeatedly kill automatons Creeponia: Wait for the event &quot;This day has become a lot creepier&quot; Celeve: kill clowns Mysterium: kill bugeyes Those dimensions you should be able to do                                                                                                                                                              AoA Expert,2016-03-27T15:16:31Z

Glad he finally figured out the heart piece thing after literally like, 70 episodes.<br>But for real though.<br>Remember that time he spent so long (several episodes) trying to get tree spirits to make those arrows and that bow he used MAYBE once?<br>Yeah.<br>No consistency.",2015-05-13T21:51:49Z
DanTDM,"Also I think it would be really cool if you changed your carpenters doors to white, You could use quartz or flour blocks or something but I think it would really match the bricks and that it would look better then dirt...",2015-05-18T17:51:47Z
DanTDM,"Dan, You won&#39;t find the trader with the MCA mod installed. He counts as a villager so he will be turned into an MCA villager, also getting rid of his special trades. Everyone like this so he can see.",2015-05-13T18:56:12Z
DanTDM,I have made a little list of mods which could be good for you:<br>Magical Crops(for Armor Weapons and resources)<br>Applied Energetics 2(for the storage problem)<br>Big Reactors(for Energy)<br>Ender IO(saving Energy)<br>Extra Utilities(a Builders wand for building and a healing axe for food)<br>Ender Storage(so you can send your stuff on a journey home),2015-05-13T19:43:04Z

DanTDM,"Hey Dan, if you keep forgetting to type the keep inventory command, just put a command block with the command pre-typed in it and press it every time before you start recording",2015-05-13T19:42:06Z
DanTDM,Hey dan! You should add the iron chests mod! That helps with the storage problem ;) ,2015-05-13T19:49:51Z
DanTDM,I hope this will helpful. That eye I think is only a one way direction so why don&#39;t you place it on the electric fence and try and see if the mobs are killing your villager see in that eye they will die or not :),2015-05-14T14:27:34Z
DanTDM,"Hey Dan, remember you first house in that village near you? (The naturally spawning one) you had tons of crystallite that you can use to repair your sword instead of using your levels every time!",2015-05-16T00:20:05Z
DanTDM,Guys! The reason why villagers are always spawning in the abyss and other dimensions is because you have &quot;Minecraft Comes Alive&quot; that mod changes every entity with trading mechanism to one of the villagers from minecraft comes alive. Please bring this to his attention. ,2015-05-14T19:32:58Z

DanTDM,Im so scared and creeped out when you are in the abyss dimension but luckily i hear your beautiful voice and it makes me more comfortable and happier :D,2015-05-13T19:18:53Z
DanTDM,"Hi Dan!<br>I know you probably won&#39;t see this but, I really recommend that you go back through your old videos.You may be able to find your waypoints again because there were some items that might&#39;ve been important but you didn&#39;t quite now how to use them (ex:zelda time block) so yea I really recommend you do that.<br>Also, I recommend that you build some sort of storage room/building to store all your stuff. It will come in handy I promise. And like sort each type of thing in a chest with a sign",2015-05-23T01:46:20Z
DanTDM,"So Dan, u seem to be having the problem where when u morph into a keese u don&#39;t have very much health. Try looking through your morphs to find a flying animal with more health than a keese. That would really benefit u in combat, don&#39;t you think?",2015-05-18T00:16:55Z
DanTDM,Put you weapons and tools in the 3 slots on each side.. Then you can fight with two swords at the same time and you will have more inventory space ,2015-05-13T20:02:39Z
DanTDM,There&#39;s a problem in your modpack: I think the villagers in the Abyss ARE the Lotteries because of MCA mod.,2015-05-14T05:31:40Z
DanTDM,Actually Dan I think you should do a start over because in the first season you were so organized and prepared and rich in resources plus you could do what you wanted because you had the time but in here you would have to wait 2 or 3 episodes to catch up I suggest doing a new mod pack because the last one like I said you were very organized and now well... you haven&#39;t even been to the twilight forest yet and that&#39;s really easy to do so yeah New mod pack new start ,2015-05-13T22:33:47Z
DanTDM,Dan needs to use night vision potions in the abyss.,2015-05-14T01:52:08Z

DanTDM,"Dan, here is what you are going to do either on your free time or during the next episode. You are going to make one normal backpack any color. Then you will use your red one. Empty the red one out and put any valuables like gold, redstone, diamonds ect. Next, get two green back packs. Use those for mob drops(one for hostile mobs and one for passive). Now get a blue backpack and put food in it. Make more backpacks for other categories of items and once you have them all label them on an anvil then put them in the normal backpack. Just remember,  Color code can save lives. ",2015-05-13T20:29:32Z

DanTDM,"Dan, the whole reason villagers from Minecraft comes alive are spawning in other dimensions is because of ID conflicts ",2015-05-13T23:54:43Z
DanTDM,you should make a mob grinder that drops them 10 blocks and doesn&#39;t allow you to hit them,2015-05-17T13:05:28Z

I have NO IDEA what causes it, but I think it&#39;s some sort of block error. it usually happens to me when, like you did, something blows up. It&#39;s almost like the block is visually gone, but the game still registers it, so it glitches you up. I&#39;ve been STUCK in those before and have had to delete the entire world.",2016-03-04T17:28:52Z

Ninja,"I love these, please do more! You&#39;re my favorite Halo player since Tom Taylor. (:",2013-04-16T19:21:19Z
Ninja,"I enjoyed this video more than the regular gameplay footage Ninja. The gameplay coupled with commentary improves what could have been just another gameplay video. Receiving advanced gameplay knowledge from a professional gamer places this video on top of the normal gameplays most others have. For me, playing Halo to win and how to get there is paramount than just watching games.

Here we&#39;re learning as grasshoppers from sensei Ninja. Thanks! I look forward to more commentary videos. ",2013-03-08T20:11:59Z
Ninja,"I love it when you use different voices. I think a good video would be to demonstrate how to use Hologram and Hard-light Shield effectively, seeing as you show us a lot of Thruster Pack game-play already. Some good points to cover would be how to position oneself and know what the other player is thinking.",2013-03-09T03:24:23Z

keep the content coming, you are helping keep our game alive!",2013-03-08T23:21:12Z

Ninja,i disagree i think it may not take as much skill as the past halo games but i would still like to see him vs other pros because it is still entertaining,2013-03-10T18:38:39Z
Ninja,Love your videos! Ive been trying to find a halo 4 channel for a while now...glad i came upon yours!,2013-03-09T04:38:33Z
Ninja,I think for halo 5 we should have ordnance but its only armor abilities,2014-06-12T01:57:47Z
Ninja,"I like tips for average Joes, I like that you break down your plays the way you do.",2013-03-08T19:51:53Z
Ninja,those two ordinance uses were on point,2015-03-30T17:35:45Z

Ninja,"Well he does kick people&#39;s asses in Halo for a living, so you&#39;d think he would think highly of his skills...",2013-03-19T16:16:15Z
Ninja,put up the simplex match showcasing what you did wrong with commentary. literally no-one does that. its great to see whats good but everyone messes up and it would be good for you to critique your own gameplay,2013-03-10T23:35:21Z
Ninja,Nice game play,2013-03-14T20:48:31Z
Ninja,"I never said anything, they&#39;re very good players but you guys saying &quot;your mad&quot; need to stop because you wouldn&#39;t have even made them drop one game or even came nearly as close as we did.",2013-03-09T22:47:55Z

Those are the highs of these past few years, but there certainly were more lows. The pandemic obviously didn’t make these huge moments in my life any easier to transition into, not to mention the fair share of personal battles along with it. We all go through tough times, but for me, watching Ninja stream was one of the biggest stress relievers during challenging times. If I needed to smile, laugh, or just feel better, I’d watch Ninja.<br><br> <br><br>Tyler, you’ve had such a positive impact on my peace of mind these last 5 years. Finding outlets like this can sometimes be difficult. In a way, we’ve sort of grown together and I’m sure it’ll be even longer since I’m such a huge supporter of yours. Any who, I want to say I really appreciate your content and hope you continue to do what makes you happy.<br><br>Cheers, <br><br>- AG",2022-12-04T08:12:55Z

It reminds me of the day living in a house with the sega, neo geo and nintendo. All played in turn. there was much fun all night.
My wife just laughs at me watching this stuff, however, you remind me of carefree days when
graphics and sound wernt so great, but mates would talk as they played.
Keep it up :)",2012-03-27T12:13:38Z

theRadBrad,I personally loved the game but after watching Brad play through this with his severe lack of knowledge on the Aliens franchise I can safely say that I feel all of the anger and frustration of those who were disappointed by this game.,2014-06-30T18:17:56Z
theRadBrad,You pull people in because of how you play and do your commentary brad...any game as long as your playing it your awesome =),2013-02-19T09:23:06Z

theRadBrad,Although I&#39;m an alien/Predator/ Terminator aficionado I did find some of the game mechanics disappointing. The aiming was atrocious and some of the weapons like the flame thrower and grenades weren&#39;t effective. I like the storyline even though it created some  discontinuity but hey I got what I paid. Paid $10 for from Amazon.,2016-04-21T20:15:54Z

theRadBrad,"Thank you Brad for playing this game. It means a lot for many of us who take games that most consider bad. I know someone else said this, you gave this game a chance just as you gave Cryostasis a chance. So thank you again and keep up the great work! P.S.  Did anyone get the feeling of stomping the alien bodies because of Brad&#39;s Dead Space 3 vids?",2013-02-19T13:28:45Z
theRadBrad,"Thanks Sooooooo...Much!! For taking the time to make these videos. If not for your hard work and effort I would&#39;ve never been able to finish this game.that was even on easy level a rough deal. Be well, May God Bless.
Bill. NY.",2013-04-30T19:56:59Z
theRadBrad,"I agree with Brad, they NEED to make a good Predator/Yuatja game, not like this though, i want a Predator game to have some sexy graphics, sweet gameplay. <br>Have me jumping off a ledge, Stab a Xeno through his head. Have my buddies in a co=op game, like we are doing a hunt together. then ill throw the Xeno scum in between all of us. then some marines will be like &quot;holy jesus wtf,&quot; And then Plasma shoulder cannon those bitches. Leave with my buddies to our ship. Make our clan. and kill shit. damn<br>I need to make a fucking game.",2015-08-02T08:14:48Z

theRadBrad,"I know I&#39;m easy to please, but this doesn&#39;t seem so bad, and considering how much I like Hicks, I can live with the bad Storyline. :P  I watched I review, but they must have done some serious patching (or you are playing with mods) because those Aliens are kick&#39;n your ass :P .",2014-01-05T23:34:51Z

Even though she had kidnapped these spartans as children, they grew up with Dr. Halsey, and she&#39;s a mother figure to them in a way.",2016-02-27T04:21:39Z

GameGrumps,"As a wrestling fan myself, I always love it whenever the Grumps play a wrestling game, even if they don&#39;t know the wrestling or anything else about it. I&#39;d love to see them play WWE All-Stars. It&#39;s basically an over-the-top wrestling game on steroids (both figuratively and literally) with combos, high jumping anime shit, and a hilariously in-depth character creator. It&#39;s highly regarded to be one of the last WWE games to actually be fun, before 2K bought the license and started making it more about simulating real life as much as possible (and All-Stars came out in <b>2011.</b> )",2018-01-19T22:19:01Z

GameGrumps,"When I tell people about a funny bit, I tell them “oh there’s this comedic duo that I absolutely love” then I ease them into the whole video game thing… you’d be surprised how often that works",2022-04-14T00:45:38Z
GameGrumps,&quot;Because you&#39;re being watched by everyone?&quot; When dan said that I imagined Arin being nervous because I&#39;m watching him play and I dont think I&#39;ve ever felt that way about this show,2022-04-13T17:51:44Z
GameGrumps,Watching Arin not do any jump attacks is killing me. I&#39;m gonna loooooooove this playthrough.,2022-04-13T17:36:14Z
GameGrumps,I really hate how easily Arin beat that knight… dude killed me like 8 times,2022-04-13T17:08:11Z
GameGrumps,"I defeated that boss that Arin ran by, by luring him onto the elevator and sending him up, at which point said enemy jumped off and killed himself.",2022-04-14T16:32:30Z
GameGrumps,"&quot;Well, I mean, that is how most people who aren&#39;t into YouTube--whoops! Kinda thought that platform would be a little stronger.&quot; A sentiment shared by every creator here",2022-04-14T07:02:36Z
GameGrumps,"If one of you talented people could make the &quot;Stab him, yas, queen!&quot; a mod for the backstab sound effect. That would be amazing. Even better if you can give it a small random chance of happening.",2022-04-14T14:51:30Z
GameGrumps,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W21qc50gOdY&amp;t=15m44s"">15:44</a> I like to think Ruckus is just a huge Rogier fangirl and she just keeps eluding to the fact that they&#39;ve already met. Yet, Rogier is far too busy and important to remember someone he randomly helped",2022-04-13T17:41:30Z
GameGrumps,I have to say you guys. This is feeling more like the good old days. First few episodes felt a little stiff but the goofiness is coming back starting around last episode and I&#39;m happy.,2022-04-13T18:31:38Z
GameGrumps,The carry bit has strong “two Steve’s” energy,2022-04-13T17:40:38Z

GameGrumps,Arin: can&#39;t beat an enemy and just wants to get past him<br>Also Arin: stands out in the fucking open waiting for said enemy,2022-04-13T19:53:26Z
GameGrumps,"“Live, laugh, fuck” signs are a fantastic and hilarious idea. I love it when people riff on those signs. You’re right… I wouldn’t buy it for my house, but I would want to really bad",2022-04-14T08:59:08Z
GameGrumps,"Dan &quot;Do you have a bow and arrow, that would be perfect for this part.&quot;<br>Me: That&#39;s exactly how I did that fight.",2022-04-13T21:04:32Z
GameGrumps,"not only does arin over-rely on the counter move and miss out on plain attacking opportunities, he doesnt even equip the curved sword talisman he got, which would make that stronger",2022-04-13T19:02:49Z
GameGrumps,"Arin using the counter attack mechanic to kick everyone&#39;s ass just made me realize how being an old school souls player doesn&#39;t always play in your favor; I&#39;ve totally ignored the mechanic and got destroyed by those knights and the bladed hawks. Didn&#39;t die once, but the assholes had me drinking like it was new years eve. Gotta be a bit more flexible; this isn&#39;t Demon&#39;s souls anymore.",2022-04-14T01:06:06Z
GameGrumps,"Arin, just two-hand your weapon and you can cheese the Scion through the door. You’re wide swinging because you’re one-handing it.",2022-04-14T00:00:35Z
GameGrumps,"&quot;Shid, Laugh, Fard,&quot; would be more on brand.",2022-04-13T18:10:04Z
GameGrumps,im glad the two are picking up on the world story as well as the told story by characters. fun fact grafting is inspired by plant grafting joining two plants together! what with Elden Ring&#39;s theme with Erdtrees and such.,2022-04-13T18:28:27Z
GameGrumps,"I love the Bad Ben callback, one of the funniest episodes they&#39;ve done in my opinion",2022-04-14T03:38:34Z
GameGrumps,"CARRY ON MY WAYWARD, GRUMPS. There&#39;ll be laughs when you are done. Lay your weary hands to rest, don&#39;t you grump no more.",2022-04-13T20:34:52Z
GameGrumps,The “Carrie” joke should not have broken me the way it did,2022-04-13T21:34:22Z
GameGrumps,"Arin did not get utterly destroyed by the Banished Knight with the halberd. I’m impressed, I thought we would be stuck there for the entire episode!",2022-04-13T17:10:05Z
GameGrumps,"I would absolutely buy a game grumps sign that says “Shid, Fard, Fuck”",2022-04-14T00:43:19Z
GameGrumps,"I remember the news report on GG, Dan answered every question in the best way possible 😂",2022-04-13T18:54:36Z
GameGrumps,"If you approach every battle or every move with &quot;I&#39;m gonna guard counter&quot;, youre gonna have a very, very, very bad time. Blocks should be situational.",2022-04-13T21:08:11Z
GameGrumps,"I honestly feel like these guys are my best friends, despite having never met them. That&#39;s just the kind of energy they give. Keep doing what you love, guys",2022-04-15T07:45:15Z
GameGrumps,"&quot;You know what Jenny, don&#39;t sing.&quot;<br><br>Probably something I would wear on an NSP t-shirt",2022-04-13T21:18:44Z
GameGrumps,"This is nice, ill never play the game but i love watching you play it",2022-04-13T17:29:21Z
GameGrumps,"Don&#39;t be hard on yourself, Arin, the spider guy is actually pretty tough and you were probably more focused and generally stronger in your home game.",2022-04-13T18:38:52Z
GameGrumps,Dan&#39;s been so great at reactive commentary in this playthrough. Randomly cracking about the load screen horse guy still has me chuckling.,2022-04-13T18:47:41Z
GameGrumps,"They were on a roll today. Great banter, funny shit, good times.<br><br><br><br>Show more feet though.",2022-04-13T17:22:56Z
GameGrumps,wonder how many episodes its gonna be before Arin realizes he has a HP debuff on him lol,2022-04-14T08:29:47Z
GameGrumps,"Mimic&#39;s Veil is a stealth item btw. If you are being chased and get away from an enemy chasing you, you can Veil and transform into an item. If you do it right they will be curious for a second and then walk away for you to quickly run up and attack them.",2022-04-14T03:41:59Z
GameGrumps,It&#39;s just so odd to see Arin use his shield...ya know?,2022-04-14T04:37:03Z
GameGrumps,"I speak on behalf of everyone when I say: yes, we expected that to happen.",2022-04-13T19:41:26Z
GameGrumps,"Dan had the right idea for shooting the grafted through the door with a bow and arrow, it&#39;s exactly how I beat it.",2022-04-13T20:01:51Z
GameGrumps,&quot;I&#39;d be working for... 2 years!&quot;<br><br>Dead inside hahah that&#39;s hilarious.,2022-04-15T23:12:18Z
GameGrumps,Dan’s demon/monster/pterodactyl scream is extremely underrated,2022-04-13T20:52:50Z
GameGrumps,"I&#39;m glad they actually saved her, I really hated that boss",2017-07-22T17:21:33Z
GameGrumps,"“Alright, so when he nut-thrusts, you have to shoot him in his piggy-codpiece, and then slash him with the laser sword. As we suspected.” -Dan Avidan, 2017",2019-07-17T23:50:49Z
GameGrumps,Dan&#39;s frustration at Arin is palpable.,2017-07-22T17:18:54Z
GameGrumps,I love how even Danny is losing his patience with Arin. XD,2017-07-22T19:33:21Z

GameGrumps,Like a little old married couple on a road trip &quot;Would you please look at the map to see where you are going?&quot;,2017-07-22T17:33:34Z
GameGrumps,One of the coolest things in this game is the wheel chair and a battery and then the electric wheel chair+ a machine gun. It turns it into a stephen hawkin chair with guns on the side.,2017-07-23T05:25:49Z
GameGrumps,"&quot;Don&#39;t hit her&quot; <br>Arin: &quot;I did naht heet her, I did naht. Eets bullsheet, I did naht heet her! I deed naaaht!.. Oh hi Mark.&quot;",2017-07-24T08:56:44Z

GameGrumps,Dan: She&#39;s dying back there.<br>Arin: Well it&#39;s her fault for not wanting a weapon<br>Dan: Wow you&#39;re an amazing rescuer. <br>Arin: I&#39;m wearing a boating hat and assless chaps would do you expect? <br>LOL,2021-10-20T16:08:24Z
GameGrumps,Arin &quot;I&#39;m gonna have a polite conversation with this gentleman while my rescue target gets mauled to death by zombies 3 ft away from me&quot; Hanson in full effect on this episode,2020-04-07T18:00:23Z

CoryxKenshin,"Whenever you think you&#39;re being followed, take 4 right turns if the car is still behind you then you&#39;re being followed.",2020-05-02T23:09:58Z
CoryxKenshin,How to win: get that car to follow you. Drive with headlights off so they are more likely to loose you. Drive to the same spot they began to chase you at. Another car will chase you. They are harder to loose bit drive with headlights off u til they loose you. Once they lost you enter the building they were at and somewhere inside the fence there is a switch that you hit to turn on the towns power.,2020-06-03T05:41:02Z

CoryxKenshin,"Cory if you drive slowly past the building where the people start following they won’t spot you. And you can escape by getting to the swampy area, following the old lady, then go to the damn and if you do it right you should have one car following you. After that you need to follow the river if you do it right the second car will get lost. After that quickly go to the place where the old lady showed you before they can find you again!",2018-06-29T02:41:22Z
CoryxKenshin,"Tip : If someone is behind you at night while you&#39;re driving a car, they start to keep their distance and suddenly they turn their lights off, that means they&#39;re most likely trying to follow you. So stay calm and try to lose them. Don&#39;t go home. Maybe call a friend and meet up at a restaurant or some place public with people. Only go once you&#39;re certain you&#39;re safe and they aren&#39;t there anymore. This happened to me and my family last year and we drove around for a while, while me and my brother watched the car until it was gone. And remember to make sure they&#39;re actually gone and not behind a hill or something.",2022-07-23T02:19:51Z

CoryxKenshin,"this sorta happened to me once. I had just dropped my friend off at 2 A.M after a party, and on my way home, three men (they looked probably 40) started following me, so I took a right instead of a left and they followed me. then I finally out drove them and I thought I had lost them. I had been driving for a while so it was about a 10 minute drive back home. so when I was probably 7 minutes away, the SAME MEN started following me AGAIN! so I went to the gas station nearby and camped out there for a while. and when they left, I went home. but when I got home. they were parked in my neighbors driveway. somehow they had found my address because I knew my neighbors and I knew they were on vacation. so I texted my friend and asked her if I could sit in her driveway (her house is in the same neighborhood, just down the road a bit) so I could call the police. when they got there, turns out the men were the cause of three missing teenagers around my age. that night was the night I stopped staying at parties past 11 P.M.",2020-07-01T01:56:56Z

CoryxKenshin,"Cory there are 2 cars that will follow you later on ( including the one which followed u ) the old lady is 90% of the game... Let me explain... There is a way to sneak past the building, the person there is actually roaming the place, once he turns his back and is walking right, he can&#39;t see you, you can drive past the building without being followed, you can find the old lady by going to that offroad path to your left, keep driving... There will be a fork... Left, straight, right. Go straight... After like... 10 seconds, u will find her, now u stop near her on the road, i don&#39;t know why but sometimes she escapes from you, but if u did it right, she will start wiggling ( sign of happiness ) she will lead you to her house ( it&#39;s a loooong drive ) when you drive near the house, you will see a picture, i don&#39;t remember what it was, but it basically says there is a switch in that parking place behind the building with the fences n stuff, so... U go back there... The 1st car will follow u, u have to lose him then go to the building again, now another car comes, more agressive and faster, lose both of them and then go to that fence, go inside, there will be an electric box ( idk what they call it ) u should open it with LMB but since this is a demo, some players will have a glitch where it won&#39;t open so try opening it by ramming it with ur vehicle ( this will 100% work, its hard tho ) then there is a switch, if u cant flip it with LMB, try the ramming with ur car thing again, once it flips down, there will be these huge electric antenas lightin up blue colored, drive out of there and it should respawn u to the begining BUT... with lights cuz of the electricity. Thats the end of the demo...",2018-05-31T22:02:30Z

CoryxKenshin,Cory pretty much just predicted about half of the FNAF 4 lore...<br><br>THIS is why he&#39;s the greatest,2017-08-14T23:12:11Z
CoryxKenshin,Wow Cory was actually right on the theory about them being nightmares!,2019-12-14T11:41:25Z
CoryxKenshin,I like how they combined all 3 screams,2015-07-14T03:39:22Z

CoryxKenshin,I can only imagine how sick this must’ve been back in 2015,2021-05-25T23:27:08Z
CoryxKenshin,This was the first video I’ve ever watched of CoryxKenshin. This video means a lot to me.,2020-01-04T06:53:05Z
CoryxKenshin,The fnaf 4 trailer gives me chills to this day,2020-12-17T13:00:23Z
CoryxKenshin,Remember the ending to fnaf 3? Where we see the news article and it says that some items will be sold at auction. What if in this game we bought some items from that auction... perhaps? The things we got are now haunting our house? I have no idea but I&#39;m so pumped for the game!! ,2015-07-14T00:20:44Z
CoryxKenshin,Crazy how Cory went from playing  the fnaf games to being in the movie,2023-06-28T04:31:35Z
CoryxKenshin,"This is my theory, Cory. The bedroom looked like a kid&#39;s bedroom. Maybe you&#39;re playing as the kid who was bitten in the Bite of &#39;87? It seemed kinda logical to me.",2015-07-14T02:12:13Z
CoryxKenshin,This was the VERY first video I watched for Cory I’ve been here for two years through his crazy disappearance I always wait for him to come back and he always has 😇,2018-05-30T06:34:10Z
CoryxKenshin,"First theory: I remember one of the first pictures Scott released looked as if Freddy&#39;s hat and other things were under a spotlight, like an auction. So my guess is that someone bought literally everything found at each restaurant and now the things are coming to life in their house. The miniature animatronics can be explained as the toys you see in FNaF 2 on the shelves in the Marionette&#39;s room!<br><br>Second theory: The person who had their frontal lobe bitten off could be having these nightmares. My guess is that the traumatic event that happened to that person caused them to block any memories that has anything to do with Freddy Fazzbear pizzeria. Now it&#39;s all coming back to them and they have nights of terror trying to run away from the hallucinations the memories are causing them!<br><br>Fingers crossed that one of these theories are correct, can&#39;t wait to see a brother play it! And what gets me excited is that the graphics look so different from the other FNaF games, I hope that it wasn&#39;t just for the trailer and that it actually looks like this! ヾ(<b>´∀｀</b>)ﾉ",2015-07-14T00:13:58Z
CoryxKenshin,"Wow, I had an idea like this since the beginning - having to hide from/ward off the animatronics inside your own home, or in whatever freaking house that is. I just recorded my reaction (But I&#39;m definitely keeping it to myself XD) and at the very beginning I just shouted at the top of my lungs, &quot;I KNEW IT!!!&quot; about five times. :P",2015-07-14T00:42:25Z
CoryxKenshin,am i the only one that feels like this is gonna make a huge success and scott will make a fifth one? in fredbear?,2015-07-13T23:45:17Z
CoryxKenshin,"Nice theory, it makes sense and would tie things together. I&#39;m very interested to see how this plays out. :D",2015-07-14T17:10:51Z
CoryxKenshin,&quot;I hope Freddy ready to get his ankles broke&quot;<br><br><b>dies</b>,2015-07-14T00:20:27Z
CoryxKenshin,"He&#39;s gonna get like 5,000 more subscribers when he play it",2015-07-13T23:38:44Z
CoryxKenshin,Pay attention to the player&#39;s perspective. You play as a child. You&#39;re eye-level with the doorknobs and only slightly taller than the bed. ,2015-07-13T23:51:34Z
CoryxKenshin,Dude! I am so psyched to see you play this man!<br><br>P.S. - Glad to see you doing so well! Still remember when you only had 100 subs- Only up from here Samurai!!,2015-07-14T00:50:25Z
CoryxKenshin,"Little did Cory know, he hit the nail on the head with that theory",2017-10-28T11:22:16Z
CoryxKenshin,"wow this is the first time I saw the trailer on this channel for fnaf 4, I hope you achieve great things someday cory.<br>-Quinnlan Boyd",2015-07-14T06:08:31Z
CoryxKenshin,Looking back at this cory&#39;s theory is basically spot on 🤔,2021-09-02T18:08:12Z
CoryxKenshin,All I can say is... hype. These FNAF games are not what they appear to be. They are fun and scary but at the same time Scott has put a lot of thought into it. Enough so that even Game Theory had to try and look for a deeper meaning.,2015-07-14T04:16:47Z
CoryxKenshin,&quot;That wasn&#39;t a restuarant&quot; Lmao 😂,2019-06-28T21:42:10Z
CoryxKenshin,Already a trailer? This is insane! :o,2015-07-13T23:40:32Z
CoryxKenshin,I called it! I SO CALLED IT! I knew the final chapter would be about someone buying something they shouldn´t have! And you can actually move in this one! THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME!,2015-07-14T17:08:48Z
CoryxKenshin,the fact that he was right when he said it was a nightmare is so funny,2022-02-07T02:59:24Z
CoryxKenshin,This video quality is so smooth it&#39;s like it&#39;s actual camera equipments on steroids,2015-07-14T20:53:53Z
CoryxKenshin,Bro really predicted the entire gameplay,2022-01-06T06:49:06Z
CoryxKenshin,Why does this remind me of Among the Sleep?,2015-07-14T00:57:53Z
CoryxKenshin,His theory is so accurate. Even from the trailer,2022-07-10T13:55:42Z
CoryxKenshin,The first time I saw this trailer I was much more scared than Cory was,2017-07-20T02:10:01Z
CoryxKenshin,"Cory, you should play Black Rose, it&#39;s a <b>really</b> good indie horror game, and it&#39;s for free on Game Jolt.<br>The developer has been reaching out for YouTubers, especially Markiplier, to get to play his expansion to the original version.<br>You won&#39;t be disappointed after playing this, and him knowing that there are people playing his game, he&#39;ll feel special again.",2015-07-14T00:07:04Z
CoryxKenshin,HYPE! I heard it&#39;s capped Bad Dreams or something but I know this is going to be super scary! ,2015-07-14T01:10:26Z
CoryxKenshin,OMG!!! This is going to be sooo awesome and freaky! Foxy and all those weird little animatronics are so creepy!!! I can&#39;t wait for you to play it cory!!!👍👍👍😱,2015-07-14T10:15:47Z
CoryxKenshin,"Childs voice: Daddy, I see monsters...<br>Dads voice: oh well, here have this plush, it&#39;s a yellow bunny! I got it from the auction! Just for you my angel!<br>Theory. Set. Motion.",2015-07-14T22:03:47Z
CoryxKenshin,Can&#39;t wait for this!,2015-07-14T00:32:49Z
CoryxKenshin,Wow look how far we’ve come. It makes me so happy,2020-11-07T02:56:14Z
CoryxKenshin,Ho-ly cow. That trailer had the feel of an 80s horror flick commercial! Did anyone else get that vibe?,2015-07-13T23:51:45Z
CoryxKenshin,"Came back here in 2022 and laughed when he said &quot;this is it guys, the final chapter&quot;",2022-03-14T23:54:31Z
CoryxKenshin,Surprised that Cory figured out that fnaf 4 was all a nightmare just from the trailer.   Ok Cory I seee youuu,2020-06-29T00:29:53Z
CoryxKenshin,"I think it&#39;s a house because remember in the last one there was an auction. There were parts of Springboob in there and someone might have bought that home, hence the whole &quot;what have you brought home&quot; question <br><br>Well, that&#39;s what I think anyway",2015-07-14T00:57:53Z
CoryxKenshin,"Considering the name of the springtrap doll is plushtrap, perhaps those &quot;few items&quot; that survived are the plush dolls on the security desk from the previous games. Perhaps you have to find a way to get the plushtrap out your home and every night springtrap (in the doll) haunts you with the phantoms (now nightmare) to kill one more kid. Or maybe it&#39;s a completely different spirit involved as there is Fredbear now too. Regardless, this is starting to sound like Annabelle the rag doll. ",2015-07-14T02:43:10Z
CoryxKenshin,Maybe Scott could fit it all in the restaurant and had to take it home😂,2015-07-16T14:37:39Z
CoryxKenshin,I can&#39;t wait for it to come out ,2015-07-20T21:52:22Z
CoryxKenshin,"Wow, that moment when Cory&#39;s theory was right...and He JUST watched the frickin VIDEO..",2016-05-26T17:46:04Z
CoryxKenshin,"It looks sooo good, I was waiting for ur vid Cory!!",2015-07-13T23:45:33Z
CoryxKenshin,"Heh, when you come back Cory you&#39;ll have a whole new FNAF to deal with.",2016-07-15T18:07:53Z
CoryxKenshin,Scott really outdid himself!,2015-07-14T12:37:18Z
CoryxKenshin,"Hi, Cory. The game may seem impossible - it&#39;s not due to actual difficulty, but poor design. You can beat the game simply by going to the top floor, picking a cardboard box to hide behind and stand there motionless until 5 AM. Any and all attempts to actually navigate the house during that time will be fruitless, and will end up with an unavoidable enemy encounter. I hope this helps.",2016-01-06T19:22:32Z

Like when I first started playing elden ring, a former dark souls 1 and 3 player, I knew what I was getting into, but also didnt cause when I started out, I didn&#39;t even know what to do. Didn&#39;t know that I was suppose to go to that tutorial thing, didn&#39;t know how to run, didn&#39;t know about the guidance of grace. But Cory over here when he started, and elden ring is a HARD AS$ game, he already knew what to do, his great at using context clues, great game sense, and just amazing combat in general. Cory u truly r a samurai.😫",2022-03-25T16:01:04Z

Interest, and the Security of our Colonies, that the several Nations or Tribes of Indians with whom We are connected, and who live under our Protection, should not be molested or disturbed in the Possession of such Parts of Our Dominions and Territories as, not having been ceded to or purchased by Us, are reserved to them, or any of them, as their Hunting Grounds -- We do therefore, with the Advice of our Privy Council, declare it to be our Royal Will and Pleasure, that no Governor or Commander in Chief in any of our Colonies of Quebec, East Florida. or West Florida, do presume, upon any Pretence whatever, to grant Warrants of Survey, or pass any Patents for Lands beyond the Bounds of their respective Governments. as described in their Commissions: as also that no Governor or Commander in Chief in any of our other Colonies or Plantations in America do presume for the present, and until our further Pleasure be known, to grant Warrants of Survey, or pass Patents for any Lands beyond the Heads or Sources of any of the Rivers which fall into the Atlantic Ocean from the West and North West, or upon any Lands whatever, which, not having been ceded to or purchased by Us as aforesaid, are reserved to the said Indians, or any of them.<br><br>And We do further declare it to be Our Royal Will and Pleasure, for the present as aforesaid, to reserve under our Sovereignty, Protection, and Dominion, for the use of the said Indians, all the Lands and Territories not included within the Limits of Our said Three new Governments, or within the Limits of the Territory granted to the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company, as also all the Lands and Territories lying to the Westward of the Sources of the Rivers which fall into the Sea from the West and North West as aforesaid.<br><br>And We do hereby strictly forbid, on Pain of our Displeasure, all our loving Subjects from making any Purchases or Settlements whatever, or taking Possession of any of the Lands above reserved, without our especial leave and Licence for that Purpose first obtained.<br><br>And We do further strictly enjoin and require all Persons whatever who have either wilfully or inadvertently seated themselves upon any Lands within the Countries above described. or upon any other Lands which, not having been ceded to or purchased by Us, are still reserved to the said Indians as aforesaid, forthwith to remove themselves from such Settlements.<br><br>And whereas great Frauds and Abuses have been committed in purchasing Lands of the Indians, to the great Prejudice of our Interests. and to the great Dissatisfaction of the said Indians: In order, therefore, to prevent such Irregularities for the future, and to the end that the Indians may be convinced of our Justice and determined Resolution to remove all reasonable Cause of Discontent, We do, with the Advice of our Privy Council strictly enjoin and require, that no private Person do presume to make any purchase from the said Indians of any Lands reserved to the said Indians, within those parts of our Colonies where We have thought proper to allow Settlement: but that, if at any Time any of the Said Indians should be inclined to dispose of the said Lands, the same shall be Purchased only for Us, in our Name, at some public Meeting or Assembly of the said Indians, to be held for that Purpose by the Governor or Commander in Chief of our Colony respectively within which they shall lie: and in case they shall lie within the limits of any Proprietary Government, they shall be purchased only for the Use and in the name of such Proprietaries, conformable to such Directions and Instructions as We or they shall think proper to give for that Purpose: And we do, by the Advice of our Privy Council, declare and enjoin, that the Trade with the said Indians shall be free and open to all our Subjects whatever, provided that every Person who may incline to Trade with the said Indians do take out a Licence for carrying on such Trade from the Governor or Commander in Chief of any of our Colonies respectively where such Person shall reside, and also give Security to observe such Regulations as We shall at any Time think fit, by ourselves or by our Commissaries to be appointed for this Purpose, to direct and appoint for the Benefit of the said Trade:<br><br>And we do hereby authorize, enjoin, and require the Governors and Commanders in Chief of all our Colonies respectively, as well those under Our immediate Government as those under the Government and Direction of Proprietaries, to grant such Licences without Fee or Reward, taking especial Care to insert therein a Condition, that such Licence shall be void, and the Security forfeited in case the Person to whom the same is granted shall refuse or neglect to observe such Regulations as We shall think proper to prescribe as aforesaid.<br><br>And we do further expressly conjoin and require all Officers whatever, as well Military as those Employed in the Management and Direction of Indian Affairs, within the Territories reserved as aforesaid for the use of the said Indians, to seize and apprehend all Persons whatever, who standing charged with Treason, Misprisions of Treason, Murders, or other Felonies or Misdemeanors, shall fly from Justice and take Refuge in the said Territory, and to send them under a proper guard to the Colony where the Crime was committed, of which they stand accused, in order to take their Trial for the same.",2016-05-16T23:11:32Z

GeorgeNotFound,"I still remember watching this when it kept coming up in my recommended. It was the first time I had rewatched Minecraft after several years. I also remember thinking that Dream was being rude, and I also watched the video where he was a parrot afterward. At that point, my mind was already made up that Dream was being a jerk to George, but as I watched more, I realized that I actually liked watching these kinds of videos. So, over a year later, I still watch them and a huge fan of the SMP and all the amazing people in the community (of course, not the toxic side). I&#39;m so happy that I actually stayed though, 2021 has been one of the happiest years of my life. All of these laughs and new content never fail to make me smile. Getting my first merch from Bad&#39;s shop, watching streams back-to-back while late at night, and showing some of the members to my sisters and them enjoying them, and noticing people at my new school wearing some merch has made me so happy. I honestly can&#39;t thank you enough with this video, George :) I can&#39;t believe that it&#39;s been so long in such a short amount of time :,)",2022-01-30T21:16:20Z

GeorgeNotFound,"Actually, all the video, I felt like George was the most honest person ever from all the participants (he didn&#39;t punch, didn&#39;t scare any of them). In the plane, George actually had worse seat then another ones. George is the one, who actually tries to figure out where they are flying, using the compass (everyone was just looking through the window 🤷🏻) and his knowledge of geography (you gonna be a good teacher, George 😉). No one actually put him up to the team, and he tried to made us sure about he&#39;s alright. When there were red lines, George&#39;s one was the hardest (actually was almost the level of his maximum; and the other ones had some space to move the finger down). Actually, I keep forgetting how to breath all the video, cause i was pretty sure, George gonna make it in his honest way. It was so heartbreaking prank in the end, but it was as heartbreaking as seeing George&#39;s reaction of 16 hours doing this so hard and as the result have nothing :(<br><br>One of the great moments was the way how Nolan tried to wear a hoodie with George ( it&#39;s almost melt my heart ☺️💔). And, you know George, you should wear that hoodie ☺️😉, of course knowing all the future before doing it.<br><br>We so proud of you, George. You did such a great job as a participant and as the content maker 😉. Happy holidays (wave to Dream from me, please &lt;3)",2022-12-26T01:21:45Z

GeorgeNotFound,You should&#39;ve coded the game so that instead of outright deleting the chunks the blocks should&#39;ve just broken and landed on the floor.

iHasCupquake,"Cupquake, thank you soo much for posting this. You don&#39;t know how happy this makes me. I really wanted this game, but sadly I don&#39;t have an xbox. When I was little, I literally LIVED for Insanely Twisted Shadow Puppets, along with all the other shorts that scared me. &quot;Ladies and gentleman, there are two kinds of stories- the ones that you can take to bed with you, and the others. Well this, this is one of the others.&quot;",2011-08-10T02:48:18Z

iHasCupquake,"@YomamasGaming I know there are a lot of great games out for PS3; that doesn&#39;t change the fact it&#39;s a complete nightmare to write software on. If you&#39;re just starting up as a small company by yourselves, it pays to focus on one singular platform (or branch of platforms) that make it easy to get something built and out of the door ASAP. This is why Sony have decided to focus the Vita around making development as streamlined as possible! ",2011-08-10T17:45:22Z
iHasCupquake,Really cool! I wish this would be a series! &gt;:O,2011-08-10T00:54:00Z

iHasCupquake,"Dear commenters: The real reason a lot of games aren&#39;t out on PS3 is because it&#39;s hard as all hell to develop for that platform. It is a legitimately good piece of hardware (or at least by 2006 standards - like the 360, both are outdated now) but suffers from poorly-managed development tools and legal hoops. It&#39;s easier to develop games for the 360 and PC simultaneously due to them sharing the same codebase.",2011-08-10T14:35:21Z

iHasCupquake,"To get to a Nether Fort, you need to just explore the Nether. There&#39;s no &#39;way&#39; to find one easier, you just need to explore! The main item you would want to get from the Nether Fortress would be Blaze Rods, which can be used for an alchemy stand and can be refined into blaze powder for potions and to create an Eye of Ender. I hope this helped.

P.S: The eyes you&#39;re referring to are for The End portal, it has nothing to do with the Nether.",2012-02-06T23:28:37Z
iHasCupquake,Its amazing its even better if you take time in everything you do but 1 down side if you die you start at lvl 0 and lose your stuff ( but you can get it back at the spot were you died ) but if you do get it best wishes :),2012-05-21T02:08:55Z

iHasCupquake,"Well there isnt really a specail way to find a Nether Fortress, you just kind of stumble upon it, its just a big thing that sometimes gos into the wall of the Nether, its kind of a purplish redish blackish block, its hard to find, because it kind of blends in with the suroundings",2013-01-27T00:13:59Z
iHasCupquake,you basically just look for the nether fortress. They are easy to spot and usually are close by if not then look far and wide i saw it in a second in my world but the hard part was that my nether portal was floating in the air above lava so it was hard to get over i had to make a path but what i suggest is when you don try to find one place something to make a pathway so you don&#39;t forget where to go and nether fortresses usually are broken in pathways and there will be more than a small fortress,2012-02-07T16:48:32Z

iHasCupquake,"@iHasCupquake it&#39;s a good thing, since now you&#39;re about the only popular channel with a fresh portal 2 playthrough :)
just after release, everyone and no one did it, and it was pretty confusing and chaotic at times :p
also, kudos to red for the computer ;)",2011-05-31T20:57:04Z
iHasCupquake,"@iHasCupquake No but the problem is that we watch anything that even mentions you.
You are a Youtube ICON! People appreciate your interaction in the comments section.
Also you are:
1.The person with THE cutest voice
2.The all round best youtube commentator and
3.The youtuber that puts out great quality videos at fast rates.
With all these great points why wouldnt people try their best to make things shift very slightly to their own personal liking?
Keep up the good work Tiff!",2011-05-31T23:07:29Z

MegMage,Shep calling Dr Chakwas &quot;Dr Chocolates&quot; has always been the one joke that completely corrupted me. She is Dr Chocolates and always will be now.,2022-11-20T21:53:20Z
MegMage,Male Shep delivers the comedic lines the best.,2022-11-15T06:25:12Z
MegMage,“I’m ready to Kela’ bitch” is forever in my mind anytime I play again,2022-11-10T18:55:25Z
MegMage,One of my favorite things is &quot;I care about you Ash--Miranda! Dammit!&quot;,2022-11-19T05:17:31Z
MegMage,&quot;Garrus am i your dirty little secret? &quot; The one romance route that so many ME fans wanted but were denied.,2022-12-22T13:13:48Z
MegMage,"These videos will forever be in my head. Actually watched them before I played the games back in middle school. Now I&#39;ve recently, like less than an hour ago, finished the Legendary Trilogy on Insanity Difficulty.",2022-11-10T06:10:45Z
MegMage,I&#39;m so glad you&#39;ve seen these. You now have the FULL Mass Effect experience,2022-11-12T22:32:48Z
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_kERaxluAA&amp;t=10m56s"">10:56</a> that head-spin lives rent free in my head as a default “wait WHAT” reaction to anything I see on the internet. Man, Gamerpoops may age, but some of them are like wine",2022-11-13T23:28:00Z
MegMage,I can’t take ME3 seriously anymore after watching Gamer Poop so many times that I associate the dialogue more with it than the game itself,2022-11-14T22:29:21Z
MegMage,The memes of We&#39;ll Bang Okay is so real that Mark Meer frequently does it at cons whenever asked with the biggest smile on his face.,2022-11-27T09:05:46Z
MegMage,&quot;It must have been such a joke to her when I became OPTIMUS <b>PRIME!</b> &quot; Remains one of the lines that never fails to make me crack up 😂😂😂,2022-12-22T03:07:11Z
MegMage,I love that in this universe Shep wants to bang everyone but he draws the line at Garrus,2022-11-20T02:50:05Z
MegMage,I’m so sad I missed this live on N7 Day but I’m so happy you watched all of them in one sitting lolll can’t wait to see you check out some of the other Gamer Poop’s especially Skyrim and LA Noire,2022-11-10T07:12:44Z
MegMage,There&#39;s something about her cackle whenever she hears &quot; we&#39;ll bang ok?&quot; That&#39;s just so wholesome.,2022-12-31T12:26:22Z
MegMage,"Will never tire of these. Episode 6 is my favorite 😆😆&quot;Damn it, why didn&#39;t you go before the mission?&quot;",2022-11-15T22:43:32Z
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_kERaxluAA&amp;t=14m45s"">14:45</a> back when the game came out and i played that dance scene with garrus, the first thing I thought of was &quot;oh damn manslayer is going to switch this with manship&quot;",2022-11-17T17:51:04Z
MegMage,"The whole exchange with Dr. Chakwas is just brilliant, one of my absolute favorites.",2023-03-22T20:28:36Z
MegMage,these episodes were originally on machinima channel. re-uploaded on the creators channel. but the entire bit with catalyst and then the follow up with Dr. chocolates kill me.,2022-11-10T18:02:39Z
MegMage,I grew up through high school and middle school with these. I miss seeing these for the first time😂😂,2022-11-10T18:13:13Z
MegMage,"Mans1ay3r shaped my entire humor about Mass Effect and Skyrim, that I can&#39;t see the original game...  I played them AFTER years of watching these, now even Platinuming all three games... Shepard is Space Sterling Archer now and forever.",2022-11-15T06:18:33Z
MegMage,These videos are a FULL EXPERIENCE. The voice actor for male Shepard loves using that line haha,2022-12-28T10:52:37Z
MegMage,Javik and his &quot;Queen among my men&quot; scene is the one that even thinking about has me laughing.,2023-02-16T14:18:42Z
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_kERaxluAA&amp;t=10m53s"">10:53</a> I had to do a double take on Shepard’s head spin.",2023-05-26T07:15:38Z
MegMage,&quot;I&#39;m Garrus Vakarian and this is my rectum&quot; has lived rent free in my head since I first saw it. These are all Mass Effect 3 plus maybe one or two Mass Effect Andromeda vids because those were the only ones available on PC at the time.,2022-11-17T15:21:25Z
MegMage,This is gold. I&#39;ve missed gamerpoop,2022-11-15T23:49:16Z
MegMage,i frickin love these they are ICONIC you need to watch the oblivion ones,2022-11-10T17:19:54Z
MegMage,I had almost forgotten how funny these are. Thanks!,2022-11-10T17:25:37Z
MegMage,"Gamerpoop is the best thing to happen to Mass Effect, since Mass Effect.<br>Got any AC planned?",2022-11-10T18:47:36Z
MegMage,Dr. Chocolates … will never unhear it.,2022-11-15T06:30:35Z
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_kERaxluAA&amp;t=6m27s"">6:27</a> Legendary moment.",2022-11-16T03:37:54Z
MegMage,"Mark Meer is an improv comedian.  To get the most out of his performance play Renegade which has all the best zingers, especially from ME2 moving forward.",2022-11-28T23:19:53Z
MegMage,Shepard’s head spinning when he hears about the secs tape is my absolute favorite part of all of them.,2023-02-26T01:43:27Z
MegMage,Garrus saying this is my rectum Is now officially my text notification sound.,2022-11-18T03:04:38Z
MegMage,"The best thing about ME3 was the gamer poops. Its a good game! don´t get me wrong, but personally for me it was a bit too big step away from the previous ones and man, Gamer poop is a legend. 10 years and I still laugh at this stuff. bullseye.",2022-11-15T09:40:44Z
MegMage,"Girlfriend: <b>starts an argument</b><br>Boyfriend: &quot;Look, i understand how you feel. We&#39;ll bang, ok&quot;.",2022-12-30T21:39:07Z
MegMage,I wish i could watch these for the first time again lol. Though its still so funny after all those years!,2022-12-01T04:00:28Z
MegMage,now we definitely need reactions to the other gamer poops!,2022-11-15T13:04:04Z
MegMage,She also needs to see the Austin powers ones too,2022-11-11T03:20:09Z
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_kERaxluAA&amp;t=5m01s"">5:01</a> most contagious laugh ive heard.",2023-07-02T16:15:39Z
MegMage,"When you&#39;re feeling blue. When you&#39;re down on your luck and you think the world is grey, just remember these words:<br><br><br><br><br><br>&quot;We&#39;ll bang, ok?&quot;",2022-12-06T08:49:42Z
MegMage,Had a dream about this last night😅. So glad it manifested,2022-11-10T17:08:49Z
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_kERaxluAA&amp;t=1m00s"">1:00</a> Damn, Shepard knew it way before we did",2022-11-27T05:40:00Z
MegMage,All those hilarious lines and you don&#39;t budge until &quot;we&#39;ll bang&quot;.,2022-12-04T14:32:56Z
MegMage,"Ok now that u seen the gamerpoop version, u need to try the &quot;TJ Laser the space scumbag&quot; version of the game which starts from ME3 lol. TJ Laser hits harder than this 60% of the time",2022-11-10T21:38:51Z
MegMage,Your laughing so cute :) thx for the funny minutes!,2022-12-24T22:21:52Z
MegMage,to me 8 is by far the best one he has ever done.,2022-11-26T20:38:07Z
MegMage,There are some things that once you see them you can never get them out of your head and things are never the same after you have seen it. Now you have seen gamer poop and the lighter side of how filthy mass effect can get on the net. Everything after that just gets darker and creepier. I would advise you to halt while a part of you is still pure. They is plenty more you can enjoy. Just beware the darker side. It may look silly and possibly sexy but there is a sinister underbelly that will only make things worse.,2022-11-10T17:57:52Z
MegMage,Mass Effect after watching gamer poop will never be the same again... :-D,2022-11-17T07:15:00Z
MegMage,OMG... I never can take Mass Effect seriously again after this no matter how sad or dramatic it is... 🤣😂🤣😂,2023-01-08T16:08:30Z
MegMage,Mans1ay3r  rode the line between YouTuber poop and Shit posting I loved it back when the original videos came out.,2022-11-10T17:22:59Z
MegMage,"Using evade will extend the time for your combo and give you time to plan your next attack. You get one normal evade before you need to do something else, but you can evade over an enemy as many times as you want and keep the combo going potentially forever.",2022-09-07T02:05:23Z
MegMage,"If you can master it, the blade dodge takedown is an extremely powerful tool in your arsenal. Unlike most other takedowns, it is extremely fast and won&#39;t leave you open to counterattacks; it also doesn&#39;t require a combo to use. If you are having trouble with it, head to the batcave and fire up the training chamber for a few rounds. I could never get the hang of it in city, but in origins I find myself actually hoping for enemies to pick up knives so I can knock them out faster.",2022-09-10T18:53:04Z
MegMage,"Also I love that in a few scenes, you see Batman&#39;s classic white eyes for just a few seconds. Like when you&#39;re hanging that one guy with the Christmas hat from the roof of the clock tower. And when you&#39;re going up in the elevator, you see it for a split second when the doors open, right before Batman disarms Gordon",2022-09-07T02:22:24Z
MegMage,I highly recommend going to the training console in the Batcave and picking the combat training option. It has a bunch of tutorials and gives descriptions on how to perform the fundamentals of Arkham combat.,2022-09-11T01:08:19Z
MegMage,I have to agree with you Meg about how much better the &quot;reconstructing the crime scene&quot; elements are in this game than they are in Asylum and City.  This time they REALLY show why Batman has the moniker &quot;The World&#39;s Greatest Detective&quot;.,2022-09-11T08:12:37Z
MegMage,"You can also use remote claw to connect bad guys to the Gargoyles,and also use it on two bad guys to hit each other.",2022-09-10T16:31:13Z
MegMage,"I admire how you&#39;re not just playing the Batman games but actually taking the time to learn about the comics, the tv series etc. It helps when ppl do their research and understand characters and stories. Great vid !",2022-09-12T08:49:03Z
MegMage,"The batclaw is your friend, haha. Use it to reach any out-of-reach items like that Riddler Data box at the end of the video!",2022-09-10T17:54:10Z
MegMage,"Hell yess! I&#39;m so glad you&#39;ve been enjoying this game so much. I agree that the way they did the evidence scanner when you&#39;re at Lacey Towers is really cool. Also as much as I love Kevin Conroy, Roger Craig Smith does a fantastic job at voicing this younger and aggressive Batman. And also I can&#39;t get enough of Alfred&#39;s wise but sassy comments that help temper Bruce&#39;s rage. Oh yeah with the Batsuit Chamber, this game has alternate Batsuits you can wear like in Arkham City but they unfortunately unlock only after you finish the game, much like in City. Since I&#39;m sure you&#39;re going to be playing the Cold Cold Heart DLC story before moving on to Arkham Knight, I believe you can look at the suits during the DLC story at the Batsuit Chamber and change into the one you want. I obviously won&#39;t spoil and say what alternate suits are in this game cause I&#39;m curious to see your reaction to some. Thanks for another great episode Meg! I can&#39;t wait for the next one! The story is really picking up now!!",2022-09-07T02:18:40Z
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WGpe8a_IOY&amp;t=22m18s"">22:18</a> That massive plant always gave me Tim Burton Gotham vibes. Oh btw in the dlc packs you can get The Long Halloween outfit which looks amazing.",2022-09-10T15:28:21Z
MegMage,You’re getting to that zen zone in combat— this is a great development. Keep it up!,2022-09-11T02:56:44Z
MegMage,"If you stop relying on the ground takedowns and use the special combo takedown once you reach x8, combat will go a lot better. The ground takedown takes too much time when there are a lot of enemies left.",2022-09-10T17:02:58Z
MegMage,"You may need to unlock it by doing something, but the disruptor has another use.  <br><br>At this time, the bad guys aren&#39;t using radios to communicate - they are just yelling. In some cases, you can sabotage the PA system in the room to stop whoever is in charge from giving orders and advice.<br><br>Like most sabotage actions though, once they realize what is going on, they WILL eventually fix it if left to their own devices.",2022-09-10T18:46:26Z
MegMage,"CSI: Gotham (&#39;YEEEEAAHHHH!&#39;)  You can get that datapack with the Batclaw.  Not that you need to worry about those, as they&#39;re the equivalent of Riddler Trophies.<br>Teenager Barbara is very helpful.  More helpful than her dad, in fact.  <br>Just want to let you know this has become one of my favorite channels, love all your Batman/Superman stuff!",2022-09-10T20:08:07Z
MegMage,"This was a christmas Batman game and i love it as the others development by rocksteady,i dont get it why some people didnt enjoy This game as the others...he should deserved tô be restored too",2022-09-10T16:01:06Z
MegMage,"Remember MegMage, when playing as Batman you must be as your Him. Utilize his skills like you see in the movies and animated series.<br><br>Use stealth against armed gunmen and your quickfire gadgets during combat. There&#39;s a training area in the Batcave to use.",2022-09-20T21:16:53Z
MegMage,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!! Thanks Meg!! Been waiting for this!!,2022-09-07T01:07:00Z
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WGpe8a_IOY&amp;t=8m35s"">8:35</a> Still funny that they by accident made a mistake with the caliber. Instead of 45 hundredths of an inch, it informs that the gun was 45mm which 4.5 cents or 1.77 inches. That&#39;s usually in range what autocannons mounted in vehicles use.",2022-09-10T16:20:50Z
MegMage,Brendan was in batman year one he was  the corrupt swat team leader. it was a real  surprise to see him here.,2022-09-07T02:37:59Z
MegMage,Loved it meg👌,2022-09-10T15:14:12Z
MegMage,Lacey Towers murder was the best case in the game tbh.,2022-09-10T16:53:45Z
MegMage,I love the batman and witcher content,2022-09-10T15:26:51Z
MegMage,"Hey Meg, here are some the batman comics which are most famous and important ones. the problem is if you check top 100 best comic books of all time there Will be at east 20 batman comics. batman has so much but also so good stories. here are some that ı recall; <br>Batman: Earth One<br>Flashpoint<br>Batman: The Man Who Laughs<br>Batman: Venom<br>Batman: A Lonely Place of Dying<br>Batman: The Cult<br>Batman: The Court of Owls<br>Batman: Knightfall<br>JLA: Tower of Babel<br>Gotham by Gaslight<br>Batman: Hush<br>Batman: The Black Mirror<br>Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth<br>Batman: The Long Halloween<br>The Killing Joke<br>Batman: Year One<br>The Dark Knight Returns<br>Birth of the demon <br>No Mans land<br>Death in the family<br>Under the Red Hood<br>Gates of Gotham",2022-09-07T02:44:50Z
MegMage,"Oh btw, I should tell you that you can slide through grates saving button mashing time.",2022-09-10T22:06:44Z
MegMage,"I recommend Batman Under the Red Hood and Dark Knight returns, they are my favorite animated movies.",2022-09-10T15:26:46Z
MegMage,"Again, try to play those combat maps to know what else you can do in the game during combat.",2022-09-10T22:12:24Z

MegMage,you planning on doing another comic book talk?,2022-09-10T15:34:48Z
MegMage,You will like arkham knight a lot more than this one. It&#39;s by far the best arkham game.,2022-09-10T22:23:36Z
MegMage,maybe see the gotham series on netflix is ​​about batman as a child BUT IT IS LONG,2022-09-10T16:32:30Z

MegMage,Please learn to use quick fire gadgets and detective vision while fighting,2022-09-10T20:51:51Z
MegMage,After this series play batman Arkham knight,2022-09-10T17:17:37Z
MegMage,Seriously you need to practice with challenge predator and combat maps.,2022-09-10T16:51:35Z
MegMage,"Arkham Origins is definetly the weakest out of all of the Arkham games, but it&#39;s still a good game.",2022-09-10T15:56:39Z
MegMage,Hi,2022-09-10T15:21:30Z
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM-Cx1wOQM8&amp;t=11m40s"">11:40</a> Fun fact with that scene. Christopher Judge, Krato&#39;s actor, recorded that scene and said &quot;I&#39;m the fucking God of War&quot; but the developers deleted it lol. You can find the video of him saying it on YouTube.",2022-10-28T15:12:42Z
MegMage,I&#39;m so glad that you&#39;re having a different experience now that you&#39;ve played the other games and know everything ❤️☺️ it&#39;s really awesome. I&#39;m so fucking hyped for Ragnarok guys.,2022-10-28T15:12:59Z

MegMage,The scene with Skoll chasing the sun and turning day into night might just be artistically the coolest scene Ive ever seen in media. It&#39;s just so beautifully done.,2022-09-15T22:41:00Z
MegMage,"Between Kratos interacting with Tyr, Freya on her quest and getting that mistletoe, the return of the Valkyries, the fight with Thor and the Wolfe chasing the sun and moon symbolizing the return of Ragnarok, I am BEYOND HYPED!",2022-09-15T21:52:39Z
MegMage,&quot;Death can have me when it earns me&quot; has to be one of Kratos&#39; best lines ever. So hyped I&#39;m already planning on take a few days off for this,2022-09-15T23:04:21Z
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4wTonoMYoM&amp;t=11m32s"">11:32</a> That’s what makes his redemption arc in God Of War 4 so satisfying and relatable. Given everything that’s been taken from him, seeing him mend his relationship with his son and gain some allies along the way warms your heart because at the end of the day, you want Kratos to find SOME semblance of inner peace.",2022-09-15T22:02:04Z
MegMage,The portrayal of the myth of Skoll and Hati is done so beautifully!,2022-09-15T22:38:21Z
MegMage,"I love that Atreus still wears the missletoe arrow that removed the curse from Baldur and allowed Kratos to kill him! I bet when Freya found it on Atreus and removed it with her sword, she was about to rage! The thing that killed her son, is a symbol of safety or protection for the child of her sons killer and the boy she cared for!",2022-09-15T22:19:41Z
MegMage,This might be the best reaction to this on YouTube. You actually paid attention to the dialog and themes and made thoughtful comments about it. Not just a spazzy reaction while ignoring and missing half of the greatness the trailer has.,2022-09-15T23:28:17Z
MegMage,I remember being in middle school and playing GOW 1 for the first time and thinking “ this is the greatest thing to hit the ps2 ever “ and damn near almost 20 years later I’m still in love with the ghost of Sparta and his story,2022-09-15T22:58:17Z
MegMage,"I love that you went back and played the older games. Too many people, especially game critics, are too quick to dismiss the old games in favor of propping up and praising God of War 4. I love God of War 4 but that story really doesn&#39;t resonate as well without the older games setting up who Kratos was and how he used to act. I find it so funny that people are like Kratos is finally a great character but he&#39;s really hasn&#39;t changed all that much. He is still the strong silent type who only talks when he has to. Of course he isn&#39;t revenge crazy no more because he already got his revenge and found out it wasn&#39;t worth destroying the world over. Anyway sorry for this long rant LOL. I&#39;m glad I found your channel.",2022-09-15T22:50:33Z
MegMage,"I am so excited  for this    game it  looks  so  awesome ! ,  also when Kratos said death can have me when it earns me , that had to be one of the coldest most badass lines I&#39;ve ever heard 🤯🔥<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>",2022-09-15T21:54:41Z
MegMage,"I have seen about 20-25 reactions to this trailer and your discussion, breakdown and understanding was my most favourite so far. Greak work 👍",2022-09-15T23:05:15Z
MegMage,I like how you recognize that hes not a different character.... people get him confused it&#39;s more so his motivations are different.,2022-09-15T22:45:19Z
MegMage,"The lines Kratos says after the most badass line I&#39;ve ever heard in a game trailer perfectly encapsulates his entire life all the way back from the original GOW games. &quot;Fate only bind you if you let it&quot; &amp; &quot;Do what is necessary, not because it is written&quot;, I feel is a nod to his time in the Greek pantheon and his middle finger to Athena and the Greek gods. &quot;We will make our own destiny&quot; is the perfect line to cap off the trailer. All those involved from Santa Monica in the making of the trailer deserves applause.",2022-09-16T17:39:18Z
MegMage,"The 2 wolves are skool and haiti from the norse mythology, they are the chasers of the sun and moon and I kinda like how the developers portrayed them in the game 👍👍",2022-09-16T07:55:55Z
MegMage,"I think it was Odin who was talking all the crap in the trailer not Tyr but, since their voice is kinda similar so, there can be a confusion that who was talking. Tyr&#39;s last dialogue in the trailer was &quot;is it a god of war you came to find&quot; . Odin is all about mind manipulation and trickery so that&#39;s why he will try to break Kratos and Atreus emotionally. Btw you reaction to the trailer was great ❤️👍🏻",2022-09-16T04:00:32Z
MegMage,"Omg yes! I was so looking forward to your reaction to this epic trailer! Loved your reaction and analysis❤, and that line by kratos, &quot;death can have me, when it earns me&quot; gave me chills. I swear if they kill off kratos I&#39;m gonna cry so bad😭",2022-09-15T23:09:57Z
MegMage,kratos and atreus’s father-son relationship is so adorable to me,2022-09-15T23:29:48Z
MegMage,"I’m really excited to see your replay of GOW2018. After seeing all the shit Kratos went through before Atreus, It’s gonna make so much more sense. And even in this trailer, there’s so much foreshadowing and call backs. Ragnarok is going to be the greatest of all time for sure. Also that line “Death can have me when it earns me” is absolute beauty.<br><br>EDIT: JUST WATCHED THE VIDEO FULLY AND IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY THAT GET KRATOS’ CHARACTER. GoW, as a whole, is all about forgiving yourself, moving on and bettering yourself; finding yourself. I am even MORE excited to see your replay to 2018 and your reaction to Ragnarok.",2022-09-15T22:08:39Z
MegMage,"Looking forward to this.  Not sure if Atreus is starting or stopping Ragnarok in that scene when he shoots the arrow and the sky is eclipsed.  The wolves are Skoll and Hati and in the triptych in the first game (2018) near the beginning Atreus basically recaps some of the lore.  I think if the wolves catch the sun/moon it starts Ragnarok and an eclipse seems like a great place to make it feasible for both wolves to catch the sun and moon.  It makes me wonder if Atreus shoots the arrow and makes the sun fall as Skoll chases it if Atreus is making it so the wolves have to start their chase again.  It may be hiw the game ends, or the eclipse could be the representation that Skoll and Hati caught the sun and moon and starts Ragnarok.  Guess we&#39;ll see.  Looking forward to your playthrough, I too already have my copy ordered.",2022-09-16T01:48:18Z
MegMage,"Always love your Kratos character analysis. I&#39;m like &quot;Yep 👏 yep👏 preach it 👏 She gets it&quot; 🤣 Soo good. <br>See ya soon, Meg, in your replay of 2018 and then Ragnarok ^-^",2022-09-15T22:52:23Z
MegMage,I love when he says could you even imagine that kind of love and she shakes her head no because she knows kratos just doesn&#39;t understand what it meant to be a god,2022-09-16T05:23:55Z
MegMage,Really enjoyed your defense of Kratos&#39; character arc.  You articulated a lot of what I have thought and didn&#39;t know quite how to put it!,2022-09-16T00:20:28Z
MegMage,"people who think kratos is a remorseless murder machine forgot about lysandra and calliope. but i guarantee you, he hasn&#39;t.",2022-09-15T22:54:06Z
MegMage,"Kratos is the interpretation of a young boy or a girl, growing up accepting his past, becoming a better person. Living, Learning, Teaching, Dying, dying happily knowing he has lived a good life in the very end.",2022-09-16T10:39:45Z
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4wTonoMYoM&amp;t=3m58s"">3:58</a> Idk why that made me laugh so hard, your first impression of Thor was something lol",2022-09-15T22:03:58Z
MegMage,I’ve always felt like Kratos really had nothing to feel ashamed of. It was the Olympian gods who got in his way of getting his revenge against Zeus for betraying him and trying to kill him. All he wanted at the end of the day was for the gods to take away the memories of Ares tricking him to kill his wife and daughter. Instead of helping him like they promised they just lied and used him. As far as I’m concerned they all had it coming.,2022-10-16T07:54:35Z
MegMage,"On <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4wTonoMYoM&amp;t=6m58s"">6:58</a> the person who Kratos carry seems to be Freya. It seems he is saving her against her own will, you can see on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4wTonoMYoM&amp;t=7m00s"">7:00</a> how she does a move with her hand and those roots appear to block Kratos path.",2022-09-16T02:34:15Z
MegMage,"If you love games mainly for the story, you should try Asura&#39;s Wrath. It is like watching an entire anime in which you are playing and is a part of.",2022-09-16T02:05:58Z
MegMage,"I&#39;m assuming the girl on Kratos&#39;s shoulder when he&#39;s running is Angrboda, the girl that we meet at the end of the previous trailer, and the two wolves at the end are Skol and Hati, the wolves that chase the sun and the moon. <br><br>By the way, loved your reaction and can&#39;t wait for your playthrough!! 😃",2022-09-15T22:23:21Z
MegMage,"God, you just ramble on and on and ON. 17 minutes to react to a three minute trailer?<br><br>Best reaction! Love your passion :D<br><br>The original GoW gave us solid gameplay, good graphics (for the time), and an epic (if straightforward) story. The sequel didn&#39;t make any major changes to the formula, but it gave us expanded gameplay, better graphics, more enemy variety, a lot more unique boss fights, and an even crazier story. I&#39;m hoping we see the same progression with Ragnarok and it looks like most of that is already true: the environments have more detail, we&#39;ll be going to all nine realms, we know they&#39;ve added elemental attacks and different shield abilities, the chainswing is back, looks like there are a lot of new enemies as well. We&#39;ll have to wait to see whether the story works, but there are several new characters to introduce and a bunch of loose ends to tie off so they won&#39;t be short on ideas.<br><br>I can&#39;t wait.",2022-09-16T03:55:48Z
MegMage,i am so excited for this to come out. LET&#39;S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. &amp; i have no doubt it will be yet another great adventure when you play this game when it is out.,2022-09-15T22:09:55Z
MegMage,"The one that said about being a god is not Tyr. When the State of Play streamed and we had the CC on, it has ODIN as the speaker. But this video has CC without the speaker&#39;s name so lots of people mistaken it was Tyr&#39;s. Tyr is the good guy here and they will work together to beat Odin I assume.<br><br>Odin is trying to mind-eff Kratos asking about being god and the godhood of his lifetime.",2022-09-16T02:29:33Z
MegMage,Omg! I was so waiting for your reaction to this. I can&#39;t wait to play this game and for you to play through this!!,2022-09-16T00:36:29Z
MegMage,"I have two theories for this game:<br><br>1-Kratos will develop an inferiority complex against Atrues because of how strong he&#39;s getting, he will get intimidated because Atreus doesn&#39;t need him by his side protecting him anymore and he&#39;s the one protecting Kratos most of the time instead of the other way around. It will not be the typical worry from a parent like &quot;He doesn&#39;t need me to protect him anymore&quot; it will be more like &quot;I&#39;m getting left behind&quot; type mentality almost like a rivalry even.<br><br>2-I believe that Atreus&#39;s identity it&#39;s going to be one of the biggest topics of this game because we know that Loki the god of mischief is the reason why Ragnarok begins and that the tale of Loki already exists in this world as we saw on Yotumheim that Loki&#39;s story was already predicted but what about Atreus? I believe that there will be an identity crisis for atreus since he doesn&#39;t know who he&#39;s supossed to be and that Atreus will be called by a different name than the god of mischief but a name that will still be accurate considering what Loki is supossed to do and be, Atreus will be either called the &quot;God of Chaos&quot; or the &quot;God of Destruction&quot; and he&#39;s also the son of the god of war so this seems very possible.",2022-09-16T19:06:19Z
MegMage,"NOW HERE IS SOMEONE WHO TRULY UNDERSTANDS THE GOD OF WAR FRANCHISE.Thank You MegMage for playing the old games and understanding them. I always hate all the damn critics who open their YAPPERS about god of war and don&#39;t evn know the first thing about it. Calling the Kratos of gow 2018 evolved, are you kidding me!!!, for us true fans, the Kratos of gow 2018 is NOT a surprise at all. Cz thats who he has actually always been.",2022-09-16T12:33:46Z
MegMage,I&#39;m so hyped for this game.,2022-09-16T15:29:06Z
MegMage,"Tyr, with the Blades of Chaos, brofisting Kratos.  I’ve seen this trailer a dozen times and it is still no less hype-infused.  <br><br>“I love his belly!”  Made me legit laugh out loud because that is so on brand for you.",2022-09-16T06:03:31Z
MegMage,"My favorite &quot;God of War games are &quot;God of War 3 and 2018,and I can&#39;t wait to add this to that list. I&#39;ve watched your entire list &quot;God of War content. It was hella fun cutie. God of War Ragnorok bad guys look cool. And the story &quot;graphics &quot;environment and action looks extremely extraordinary. 🤩 . . . Fantastic video &quot;MegMage⚔️✨️🙌",2022-09-16T00:56:45Z
MegMage,"In Norse Mythology, Sköll and Hati are the sons of Fenrir and grandsons of Loki. Sköll and Hati chase the horse-drawn chariots of Sól and Máni, the personified sun and moon respectively, every day and night until they finally catch them, marking the onset of Ragnarök.",2022-09-23T09:05:46Z
MegMage,"The eclipse scene is nothing more than the wolves Skoll and Hati (Grandsons of Atreus or Loki) starting their prophetical chase. One will chase the sun and the other, the moon and when they eat it Ragnarok begins.",2022-09-19T21:19:36Z
MegMage,About time..I was waiting on this! 😎<br>Actually was looking for tour reaction yesterday! U rock MM!,2022-09-15T22:37:18Z
MegMage,God of War is so good because it&#39;s both story and gameplay wise AMAZING,2022-09-16T10:40:16Z
MegMage,Am I the only one who sat down at 3AM crying from excitement seeing the trailer?,2022-09-16T10:37:02Z
MegMage,"You should react to the Gotham tv series, it ran for 5 seasons and it&#39;s about Bruce Wayne as a child before he became Batman, the show also creates their own origin stories for Batman&#39;s enemies like the Joker, Scarecrow, Bane, Penguin, Riddler etc. It was a fantastic show",2022-09-16T05:07:19Z
MegMage,"These are live conscious Valkyries, the others from the first game were soul trapped puppet Valkyries (which is why they thank you when you beat them and their souls would fly away).",2022-09-18T00:56:40Z
MegMage,"Odin&#39;s rhetoric questions confuse me a bit since Kratos has been loved, worshipped and prayed to by his spartan subjects when he was the official, Greek God of war, at the beginning of GoW 2 (before the fight with the giant statue). He moved at the behest of his subject&#39;s prayers, sure, not selflessly but for the thirst to fight, conquer, etc. However, the fact still remains that he has been viewed and treated as a proper God.<br>So, I wonder if this is simply Odin&#39;s perspective we hear. That he cannot belive someome so <b>relatively</b> &quot;benign&quot; and &quot;caring&quot; could be what he thinks of a God. Interesting.",2022-10-15T15:44:14Z
MegMage,"I believe the second voice narrating, criticizing Kratos, was Odin, it sounded slightly different and more unhinged than Tyr we heard at the beginning. I can&#39;t wait to see the interaction between Kratos and Odin after we heard so much about him in the original game, since it&#39;s obvious he knows all about him. If that is Odin, that&#39;s going to be such a compelling antagonist for Kratos to prove wrong. It&#39;s also interesting how Thor, essentially the attack dog for the Aesir God&#39;s, is where Kratos was when he was serving the Olympians, he was their attack dog. Thor is like Kratos&#39;s past self, that fight will be a clash between who he was and who he&#39;s become since killing the Olympians, remarried and fathered a son. The combat looks faster, with that attack you can do when you come out of a jump, and the blades used for traversal. The girl Kratos was carrying was either Angoboda or maybe Freya?",2022-09-15T22:30:51Z
MegMage,Death can have me...when it EARNS me. 🔥,2022-09-15T23:17:05Z
MegMage,The wolves who are chasing the moon and the sun are called &quot;skoll and hati&quot;. If they catch the sun and the moon &quot;Ragnarǫk&quot; will begin,2022-09-15T22:28:06Z
MegMage,"Also I love that of the reactions I&#39;ve seen of this trailer, I think you&#39;re one of the only ones to point out Thor&#39;s belly and love it!",2022-09-16T00:45:23Z
MegMage,"The two sides of humanity, berating and then concern.",2022-05-09T05:33:16Z
MegMage,I feel like this when my kid gets hurt doin something stupid...,2022-05-24T18:25:55Z
MegMage,true to life,2022-05-08T22:40:54Z
MegMage,"The explosion is from a trap, not from her.<br><br>So, she isn’t crazy to ask why Geralt is touching things in a place with traps.",2023-03-03T18:15:10Z
MegMage,The absolute greatest video game of all fucking time!!!<br><br><br><br>Pardon my enthusiastic language..,2022-07-19T02:34:36Z
MegMage,Too bad there&#39;s no Marti Sodergen in this game. I wonder if she really would f**ck Geralt &quot;even on a hedgehog&quot; - like she said in the books... knowing that Geralt was eavesdropping.,2022-05-08T20:54:23Z
MegMage,"What&#39;s bad about characters being beautiful, they make the game more beautiful. Women in Witcher are not perfect though, they all have strong and weak sides and their bad qualities, good looks don&#39;t make them perfect, so",2023-07-08T06:26:04Z
MegMage,This game still looks so good IMO. 😍,2022-03-07T15:12:53Z
MegMage,Ooh! I missed this series! Glad it is back. &quot;How can I help detective?&quot;,2022-03-07T15:38:53Z

MegMage,"Meg: So, this is what weed did to him?<br><br>Me: No, this is what shooting at Meg does to you.",2022-03-09T07:40:37Z
MegMage,"Yes, this is a DLC mission (there‘s 2 on the Vice desk). The DLC missions are not linked to the overarching plot (which is indeed about the army morphine and other, even more sinister, stuff…)",2022-03-07T20:54:20Z
MegMage,"Hawkshaw outfit is easily my favorite, love the play through one of the better detectives I&#39;ve watched.",2022-04-18T18:30:20Z

MegMage,You&#39;ve done so many street crimes and have gotten to such a high rank. I&#39;ve never even seen that outfit 👌 I wonder what happens when you get all 40 street crimes,2022-03-08T02:57:52Z
MegMage,That was a great game,2022-03-07T16:18:17Z
MegMage,There is a lot of car chases as well if you have not done them they are in the game some where I love your channel,2022-03-08T00:06:44Z
MegMage,I was starting to think you were done with this game,2022-03-08T02:28:19Z

MegMage,I love Legion. He&#39;s an amazing character. So well written (And it&#39;s so funny to do Tali&#39;s loyalty mission with Legion on the team. The Quarians flip their shit),2021-07-28T22:31:31Z
MegMage,"<b>acquires an intact geth, has a key to any knowledge about the geth and synthetic life in general</b><br><br>&quot;Does it have a peepee?&quot;<br><br>I&#39;M DEAD XD XD XD",2021-07-27T16:30:19Z
MegMage,"I&#39;m really glad to see you&#39;ve taken a shine to my absolute favourite character in the series ^^ Legion is really special as far as the geth go, and you might have noticed that parts of their head were making motions while they was talking. Their &quot;body&quot; was specifically designed for interacting with organic life (hence how they can hold 1,183 geth programs as opposed to the average 100), so the mobile platform is actually attempting to mimic facial expressions ^^ Its a nice little touch",2021-07-27T17:00:55Z

MegMage,Legion is a better Shepard fan than Conrad,2021-07-27T16:27:06Z
MegMage,"If you hang around Legion long enough he&#39;ll start to dance. Something similar happens with Joker in the cockpit. If you wait about 20 minutes you&#39;ll hear some very NSFW sounds before Joker cuts it off and says &quot;Sorry, that was meant to go to my earpiece.&quot;",2021-07-27T20:20:59Z

MegMage,"Hi Meg! I noticed that you should have way more likes than you do with the amount of views you have.

I often have to return to the previous video because I forgot to like.<br><br>I suggest a short pre-recorded segment of you amicably reminding us to hit like if we liked.

MegMage,Legion is one of my favourite characters. The whole gets/quatrain history and ingame story is one of my faves.<br><br>I never properly noticed until Meg pointed it out that Legion and Tali have the same powers. I love that it’s a subtle nod to the inextricable link between geth and quarians,2022-12-22T23:14:09Z
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAGhG2S35OM&amp;t=1h19m35s"">1:19:35</a> hahaha, perfect expression of how everyone who plays this game feels at that moment",2021-07-28T05:32:23Z
MegMage,There&#39;s a significant amount of cut content for Legion. It was originally meant to be one of Shepard&#39;s earliest companions.,2022-12-20T10:52:18Z
MegMage,"I don’t think anyone’s mentioned it, but the Shadow Broker’s logs reveal Legion has 1) sent EDI the equivalent of “sent nudes, pls answer” and she turned him down, and 2) has the equivalent of a CoD account and competes in tournaments, AND downloaded a quarian dating sim game.",2022-03-30T23:15:12Z

MegMage,"Having played RDR1 first profoundly affects your experience with 2.<br><br>One of my favorite scenes is the ending of Chapter 1 when they ride their wagon trains through the fog as they&#39;re riding out of the mountains.<br><br>There&#39;s all these grand, sweeping shots of the landscape that we really hadn&#39;t had yet, and this angelic, hymnal music.<br><br>This beautiful and epic beginning to an adventure you already know is doomed. <br><br>Goddamn beautiful.",2022-06-10T06:20:58Z
MegMage,This game really makes you feel like a bad ass gunslinger that can shoot your way out of any situation until the end.  I was so shocked and as a result playing Red Dead 2 I was so cynical just expecting bad things to happen constantly. So it’s always interesting to watch people playing in chronological order.,2022-10-07T22:25:15Z
MegMage,"Jack, the last member of the Dutch Van Der Linde gang, tide up all the loose ends.<br><br>Funny how he met Ross as a boy when fishing with Arthur, only to meet Ross&#39;s end at the different river.<br><br>Another fun fact is that Jack is also canonically the fastest gun slinger, Ross never stood a chance.",2021-07-28T23:21:22Z
MegMage,Whenever I see that scene it reminds me of when Ross said “enjoy your fishing kid” to young jack in rdr2.,2021-04-05T17:35:07Z
MegMage,Played this in the dorms at college when it came out in 2010. Really blew me away. Those song moments throughout the game were unlike anything I’d experienced. And John is such a special character. Loved your playthrough!,2021-04-05T07:22:36Z

MegMage,When Jack turns and the music and the end title screen plays is such an epic ending…great play thru…it is interesting no matter how many replays I watch from different people the reactions are all pretty much the same…what a masterpiece of a game…keep up the good work.,2021-09-21T16:50:20Z
MegMage,"There is an easter egg in GTA V which is a book written by a J. Marston about the wild west. While this might be just an easter egg, it could also indicate that Jack Marston did not become a gunslinger, instead became a Writer just like how he wanted to be in Red Dead Redemption 2. Maybe Arthur&#39;s sacrifice, John&#39;s sacrifice, everyone&#39;s sacrifice in the end did save the last member of the Van Der Linde gang from going downhill",2021-04-05T05:36:14Z
MegMage,Love your streams Hope you have a safe week Qld got a lot of rain this week,2021-04-06T01:09:16Z
MegMage,Fun detail the gun on the armoured vehicle is a Maxim gun in the Fort assault video I mentioned that Gaiting guns were very common in RDR1 within Mexico and New Austin while in RDR2 it was the opposite Maxim guns were the main machine gun used in that game. In RDR1 there are only two Maxim guns this one and one surprisingly in Mexico while RDR2 only has two Gaiting guns found in New Austin. <br><br>The speech given by Dutch on the cliff is the same one he uses when he and Arthur and surrounded by the US army he buys time and then they both jump off  the cliff only this time there’s a river below.,2021-04-05T03:15:32Z
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ScaOgob8S8&amp;t=3h18m51s"">3:18:51</a> There is no way to save John.. even if you do manage to kill all the enemies, one survives no matter what. Agent Ross is invincible and you can’t kill him, if he’s aimed at, he’ll be marked with a friendly cursor, making it a failsafe to stop the player from killing him… even if you could the game would probably be scripted for John to be shot in by nobody in that case",2021-11-06T11:03:29Z

MegMage,"A common theory about Abigail is that she died from tuberculosis. She could be heard coughing during the Beecher’s Hope chapter of this game. It’s possible she could have even contracted it from Arthur, because TB can be dormant in one’s system for years, especially when the person lives in a warm and dry climate like where Beecher’s Hope is.",2021-04-15T06:59:02Z
MegMage,Meg sounds happy about Jack killing Ross. But the moment he did that he just put a bounty on his head. That’s the message of RDR. Revenge is not worthy because it backfires. It’s not worthy to look back. John did when he decided to go after Micah. Jack did the same when he decided to go after Ross. The unending cycle of violence.,2023-07-10T18:45:22Z

MegMage,"Both Templars and Assassins have their good times and bad times. The American Brotherhood was as bad as the borgia family, of which the modern Templar are ashamed. I think that if there were more great masters like Haytam, there could be an agreement between these two groups someday",2023-07-06T08:30:11Z
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YKoiTcirAQ&amp;t=21m30s"">21:30</a> It&#39;s now June 1756. Shay is 24. Haythem is 30 and still in the Ottoman Empire looking for his sister. Connor is 2 months old.",2023-07-07T17:35:51Z
MegMage,"I remember when first playing assassin’s creed 2, we were teaming up with Thieves. I was like “but thieves are bad”… when Shay was stopping the gang members from hurting the old couple, I said “Yup, bad association for the Assassin’s”",2023-07-07T21:10:12Z
MegMage,"Remember the Assassins aren&#39;t always the good guys. Altair&#39;s Brotherhood was riddled with flaws and they basically were Templars themselves (hence why Altair&#39;s 9 targets all made the comparisons) and Achilles said in AC3 that he failed the Brotherhood and said to Connor &quot;in your haste to save the world, don&#39;t destroy it&quot; which was basically referencing this game. The Templars are still the overall bad guys but sometimes the Assassins can so far the Templars opposition makes them look like the good guys, made more understandable by the fact that some of them actually do believe themselves the good guys. <br><br>By this stage you&#39;ve seen Liam keeping tight lipped around Shay for simply trivial questions, the French Assassin basically having the mentality of a Templar and Hope blindly defending Achilles against Shay&#39;s accusations without question. Achilles even risked destroying the entire Homestead and killing everyone on it by having Chevalier open fire on it just to stop Shay when even Ezio risked surrendering the Masyaf keys for Sofia (you can even hear an Assassin in the background saying &quot;Has Chevalier gone mad? He&#39;ll destroy the Homestead!&quot;). <br><br>But as you noted Monro and Gist actually give Shay more detailed answers to his questions than the Assassins did because that&#39;s what planted the seed of doubt within Shay&#39;s head, so if they&#39;d been more open things might&#39;ve been different. Also good observation you made about Liam having anxiety and not wanting to question Achilles but that was the flaw with Altair&#39;s Brotherhood and why Ezio&#39;s was more effective. Overall the Assassins in this game treat the brotherhood like a cult they obey without question because it saved them from the streets but have no value for its principles and Achilles authoritarian outlook only encourages this.",2023-07-07T23:27:53Z

MegMage,Heyyyyy,2023-07-08T07:08:56Z
MegMage,"You seemed a bit confused, so I will clarify. You might&#39;ve figured it out, but just to make sure. When Kratos saved Sindri from the dragon, he gave Atreus the gift of mistletoe arrows, shortly there after (before they meet Mimir) Kratos noticed that Atreus&#39; quiver strap was broken, so he repaired it with one of the mistletoe arrow tips, the next time that Kratos and Atreus went to Freya&#39;s house she noticed the mistletoe arrows Atreus was carrying and demanded that we give them to her, she destroyed them and demanded that if we ever came across more that they would destroy them. The reason is that she knows that is the only thing that can break Baldur&#39;s curse. Freya didn&#39;t notice the arrow tip that was used to repair Atreus&#39; quiver strap though. So when Baldur punched Atreus, the arrow tip was driven through his hand and made him vulnerable.",2021-03-07T20:51:06Z
MegMage,"After the full credits, the game comes back and Atreus has a conversation about the dream he just had. That fimbulwinter was ending and Thor came to the house. Kratos reassures him that it was only a dream, but Atreus tells him that it didn&#39;t feel like a dream, it felt real. It felt like...the future. That secret ending is a prophecy that Atreus just had. Now that he knows he is a Giant, Atreus is starting to unlock that power.",2021-03-07T21:32:59Z
MegMage,"One of those small detail things again. But when Kratos jumps off the chisel with Baldur, if you look at Kratos he looks behind himself to see how far of a fall it is, then he gives Atreus a nod and look over his own shoulder again to signal to the boy that he is jumping and wants Atreus to follow. Plus no hesitation out of Atreus there either. They&#39;re working together so well at this point.<br><br>Just that small moment shows the character growth of both Kratos and Atreus. Earlier in the game Atreus was unsure of himself and Kratos was a tad over protective. Now they completely trust themselves and each other to the point where they don&#39;t even need to say a word to know what to do.",2021-03-07T20:00:34Z

I relate somewhat, I suppose. I&#39;m an unbearably lonely individual, like the kind of guy that has some Facebook friends but in real life I&#39;m alone all the time. Go to work, go home, have nobody to socialize with, etc. In my solitude I began to collect stuff, I have a bunch of mainly Marvel or Star Wars figures and some nice art prints. Found a Facebook group where I can share pics of my collection and it feels nice to have a community of sorts to geek out over stuff with. Keep up the entertaining content!",2021-06-03T04:37:46Z

alliebeemac,"Rarely have I seen a game get so much shit without any chance to show some of its qualities. I generally like your stream videos but this game seemed to have triggered you from loading screen one. The same dude who helped create the RE license was behind this game, and his usual sense of surreal very Japanese quirky horror was evident. Is the characterization the best in this game or the acting? No, but is it as bad as it&#39;s being made out to be? Not at all. Furthermore, this game was quite well received by many horror fans and gamers of various likes and backgrounds. Then there are those who didn&#39;t like it for various reasons. Clearly you don&#39;t like it, and I can&#39;t bring myself to watch this or the other video all the way through so eve if that opinion changed at some point I won&#39;t be able to see it.<br><br>If you really can&#39;t find the &#39;logic&#39; in a game where you&#39;re in the horror matrix and things are explained shabbily to begin with to lay the groundwork for a setting rather than a reason then I would suggest not playing games you don&#39;t like in the future. It may be better for your health and general enjoyment of life.",2019-02-24T10:42:52Z

alliebeemac,Fun little detail you should know about the classic games is Doom 1 and 2 took place in 2022 over 130 years before the events of Doom 2016 and Eternal. You played as a Marine of the United States military more retro Military look with combat armour instead of the power armour we see in the more modern games. He was sent to a UAC mars base because he didn’t listen to his officer when ordered to fire on civilians (Unknown Earth Conflict) when the UAC bases were attacked by demons basically first contact with humanity. Doom 1 midway through the demons attacked Earth and in Doom 2 “Hell on Earth” you fight in city’s on Earth for the first time. This attack wasn’t as impactful as the one we see in Doom Eternal but was just like any other conflict instead of enemy human soldiers there was demons. This could be the reason for Earth forming under a United Earth most nations would’ve fallen. The formation of the ARC is very interesting as they were formed to combat demons so this could’ve been created after humanity saw what the demons could actually achieve. At the end of Doom 64 which take place after Doom 2 the marine stays in Hell to fight the demons so the big question us old school fans have is how does the new Doom games link to the classic ones (a lot of us thought Doom 2016 was just a reboot having nothing to do with the other games) and my theory is Time moves slower in hell as it’s a different dimension. The Armour The Slayer wears  in Doom 2016 isn’t his Original Combat Armour and from the look of the armour and how the scientists in Doom 2016 spoke about it shows that’s it’s not from Earth. The Doom Slayer as he’s known now has history with the Night Sentinel a people from a different planet far from our part of the galaxy so there’s so much story missing between Doom 64 and Doom 2016 which this game will hopefully answer. Cannot wait to see how you find this game.,2020-03-22T20:11:24Z

Definitely the quickest I have fallen in love and become attached to the characters. (Gabe was a big reason, so guess we&#39;ll have to see how the vibe goes without him :( ) <br><br>I adore the first game but oh my god the awkwardness when Max spoke to literally anyone and used some hello fellow kids slang, I felt pain. <br> <br>The second was such a wholesome intro, I loved the dad so much, and then it had such a quick and sad drop into the sadness and pain.<br><br>However, this felt more natural with how the characters interacted. I really enjoyed watching them interact with each other and getting to know them. Even with knowing Gabe wouldn&#39;t last, I still adored him and couldn&#39;t stop myself becoming attached. <br><br>I don&#39;t know where the story is going to go, I have managed to avoid spoilers. But I am loving Alex so far and can&#39;t wait to see how it all works out and how her power comes into play.<br><br>See you in the mosh pit, shaka brah&#39;s",2021-09-12T06:00:18Z

alliebeemac,"Regarding the part @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YYIzYCSAO8&amp;t=1h00m00s"">1:00:00</a> in roughly, I actually had a very similar conversation with my (current) husband after our first date. I really wanted to have sex with him, but after we had sex, I was scared shitless that he was gonna hit it and quit it. So after an awesome anxiety attack, I texted him and told him why I was worried and that I wanted to hold off on sex for a while and his reaction was absolutely perfect, and probably strongly contributed to us staying together. He basically said that we could absolutely hold off on sex, he wanted me to feel comfortable and sex wasn&#39;t the important thing to him. He said he genuinely liked me, wanted to get to know me better, and he went into relationships looking for something that would last (so not the hit it and quit it type). We went on a few more dates after that sans the sex and got to know each other better and he couldn&#39;t have been more sweet or respectful. So yeah, long story short, this guy Isaac seems like one of those &quot;nice guys&quot; that&#39;s actually just a total douche canoe.",2021-10-19T07:27:54Z

alliebeemac,"Honestly, I usually kill the Twins and spare Joseph. Changing your mind at death&#39;s door with a gun to your head doesn&#39;t feel genuine.  Joseph actually acknowledges his failures and atrocities even when he&#39;s perfectly capable of walking away. He even ASKS to die out of guilt. Which is why I let him live. He either lives with the guilt forever and suffers more than the release of death would give him, or he comes to terms with it and becomes a better person in his final years. <br><br>The Twins did the exact same things Joseph did minus the justification of actually saving anyone. They were Joseph, but worse. I think it especially makes sense in character since the Captain didn&#39;t actually see the bad stuff Joseph did and has mostly just seen him be helpful. They&#39;ve only heard secondhand stories about bad things that happened 17 years ago in a different world. Most people would ignore the cries of mercy from the person who killed their father figure and be far more lenient to someone helpful to them who did the same kind of thing 17 years ago to people they&#39;ve known for a few months.",2022-12-26T09:47:22Z

So, for the twin I think than they are not good as the Seed family, the Seed was develop and unique in all their way but the twin was, well TWIN😱 and when you see them you know than teir &quot;people&quot; are just here by fear or because they have the same point of view who is &quot;this is apocalypse, I can what I want&quot; but for the father its different....Joseph Seed as many follower not because of fear or power no, he as follower because they worship him and see him like a new Jesus, of course some of it have been force but they believe in him now and until the end even if all the other Seed have been kill, I&#39;m not saying is right because he IS a mental imbalance but his sect is really attractive, I even think than in reality I could join(I say COULD but now if this happen I will just run away) and if we have to talk about the people on mind control by the &quot;grace&quot; and the &quot;Angel&quot;(so the people who are in overdose of grace) well of course its a crime but the father say it &quot;I&#39;m not claiming to be perfect&quot;....and if you remember ALL the people who was on mind control than you, we the player have seen, what have we do?We kill them all, even if we are ourself on different mind control (so the one of Jacob and the one of Faith) making us even MORE dangerous than any member of the sect  and the prove than we can save people from the &quot;grace&quot;, even at the canon end of the game we SAVE EASILY are friend from the &quot;grace&quot; making us (the rook) a real monster bastard....ho and Joseph I don&#39;t think you will agree but in New Dawn Joseph IS a good guy (atleast is show like a perfect Jesus man) and he even give us super power anf if this mean than for having super power in New Dawn three nuke have to explose...HELL YEAH F**k THE WORLD GIVE AND ME SUPER POWWWWWWWWWERRRR.For finish is really kind and help is people who all love him, so even if he is the one who lauch the three nuke we can see than the world is pretty good, I mean seriously HAVE SEEN ALL THE PINK FLOWER its magnificent and there is no more war!If we forget the twin but they are the main antagonist of the game so its the point and Joseph people are fine and even more happy and healthy than the rest so we have NOT destroy all the sect bunker for NO reason more people will have survive and maybe join or not his healthy village...I hope somone will read it or this mean than I have write this at the middle of the night for nothing 😅(ps: If my English is bad its because I&#39;m french 😀)",2020-06-14T00:08:32Z

alliebeemac,"Haha, I know it&#39;s too late but I had the opposite problem as you when it came to my partner. I set 2B to be aggressive (except when I went to the amusement park). She was great when we were fighting enemies. She took them down almost as fast as I did (faster when I didn&#39;t hack).

alliebeemac,"I&#39;m very confused by people feeling the need to defend Bose and his actions. He clearly abused Jimmy in some way shape or form. You don&#39;t take off your tie and wrap it around your hand as you&#39;re talking to someone you&#39;ve locked in a hotel room with you &quot;to talk&quot;. He at the very least physically abused him. But given that it sounds like Jimmy was at least a young man by that point, to me it seems more likely it was something else. Given Jimmy is a strong, able bodied, already violent young man, and loud and dramatic to boot, I don&#39;t see him cooperating too much with an older out of shape man who he&#39;s already afraid of and aggressive toward beating him with advanced warning like that. He very much seems like he&#39;d scream and fight back, which would make what was going on pretty noticeable to everyone in the hotel and probably leave Bose with at least some bruises of his own. It seems more likely to me that some kind of intimidation/abuse that Jimmy didn&#39;t know how to deal with caught him off guard and unable to defend himself. Especially considering what Bose said and the way he said it.<br>The scrapbook could&#39;ve been Jimmy trying to figure out what&#39;d been done to him, or something he was driven to make out of worry that Bose might hurt him, or something he made prior to meeting Bose as some manifestation of fears he already had about doctors as young man realizing/thinking he was mentally ill, and hearing horror stories about how awful institutions were.<br>Even if Bose didn&#39;t sexually abuse him, I can understand Jimmy making that up, out of fear people wouldn&#39;t take Bose beating him seriously. Jimmy shouldn&#39;t have to put up with being physically abused either, and if lying about what exactly happened was the only way he felt he could get justice and be safe, I can&#39;t really blame him. Bose has no excuse putting his hands on a patient he should have had committed for inpatient treatment the moment he realized he was a danger to others. There is no &quot;What Jimmy did drove him to extremes&quot;, there is no excuse for a doctor abusing a patient he&#39;s there to help. Beating a patient does them no good, and a doctor would damn well know that.<br>But the thing is, Bose&#39;s actions pretty well indicate this probably isn&#39;t the case. Cops are much more likely to trust a doctor with no prior record of abuse than a violent mentally ill young man with probably several complaints and accusations against him. Even substantiated accusations of beating Jimmy, Bose probably could&#39;ve gotten ignored by police by detailing the things Jimmy had done. Accusations of sexual abuse with no proof and the squeaky clean doctor saying &quot;No, this kid has made false accusations against me before, he&#39;s fed me glass, he kills animals, he played a part in the death of a young girl, he&#39;s deranged, he needs to be committed.&quot; would be ignored by police faster than you could sneeze at, <i>whether or not they were true.</i> And Bose would know that, he would very well know his career isn&#39;t instantly over, and he wouldn&#39;t be THAT afraid of police involvement. That pretty strongly indicates Jimmy and Rose went to the police with some kind of  proof (sheets, clothes, a r@pe kit, corroborating bruises or marks, etc).<br>Soooooo, Bose is almost certainly a creep and probably a molester, in my opinion...",2021-05-02T10:08:17Z

Your reactions are so legit, you got another sub!<br><br>What I will echo though, like many of the other comments, is that you should either go back to certain chapters since you missed some small things...like in the hospital won&#39;t spoil it...OR what you and Dwayne could do in your other channel is react to the other choices that you didn&#39;t make so you can see all the outcomes. I think it&#39;s worth checking out. But good job on the playthrough it was super entertaining!",2018-05-30T00:26:24Z

JazzyGuns,"This game is actually more fun than I thought it would be! I realized after recording that I need to access the online side so I can see the other outfits I unlocked, get login rewards, and things like that. I have already customized my character a little bit as well as add upgrades to my support characters, but that was after i stopped recording. Only thing I think is a downside is the very difficult way for you to invite your friends to play, still trying to figure that out 😅",2019-02-13T23:07:25Z

JazzyGuns,You don&#39;t have to play as yourself you just did that press the O button to unchoose a character and you don&#39;t need full bars of charge to use one move you usually need 1 some require more then 1 though,2019-02-17T15:52:58Z

JazzyGuns,Nemesis is back to remind us why he is the most feared B.O.W of all!,2020-03-19T19:29:31Z

JazzyGuns,"Here&#39;s a tip for fighting nemesis: use quick step as soon as he punches you to initiate the Dodge and press left trigger for time bullet to shoot, shoot the chest since because the device covers the heart, use environment (such as barrel or electrical circuit) to stun nemesis, and when nemesis is on its knees after shooting it, you make a run for it. If you have the knife out when you dodge, you&#39;ll do a slash after you dodge.",2020-03-19T19:58:36Z
JazzyGuns,Just finished this demo and almost crapped my pants towards the end 🤣<br><br>I can&#39;t WAIT for this game!,2020-03-19T19:37:45Z

JazzyGuns,"It’s so hilarious cuz she’s always giving every zombie random names and it’s so funny, that’s one of my favorite parts of her walkthrough",2020-03-20T21:19:10Z
JazzyGuns,"Is that weird that I wasn&#39;t scared by the nemesis? The last time I got scared while playing a horror game was playing dead space at maximum difficulty and I was running out of ammo. Losing control over the situation, I think that&#39;s the only thing that can make me scared in a horror game now.",2020-03-19T19:38:53Z

JazzyGuns,I love how thorough you are when checking every nook and cranny. It makes it easy to watch gamers like you because you play smarter not harder.,2020-03-19T20:17:28Z
JazzyGuns,SO looking forward to your play through of the full game when it hits,2020-03-19T22:14:26Z
JazzyGuns,seeing all the locations and architecture from the street in classic re3 is a nostalgia trip,2020-03-20T01:08:45Z

JazzyGuns,"The fact she named all the zombies as she fought them? Bahahahahaha. I was lowkey mad at how u didn&#39;t realize the red barrels were explosive, but after watching you play more, you explored a lot more in your first run than I did so I couldn&#39;t be mad. I finished the demo rather quickly and was confused on why it was so short so shoutout to you for this vid, lol",2020-03-20T02:44:08Z

JazzyGuns,I can&#39;t wait to see you do the full gameplay!!!  I happened to see most of the full game someone uploaded from France! This game will be more action oriented and harder than Re2 remake!,2020-03-23T18:40:19Z

JazzyGuns,Jasmine’s out for Wonder Woman’s blood 👀💀,2018-03-16T00:04:37Z
JazzyGuns,"I know that Jasmine said that she wouldn&#39;t use the &quot;manual&quot; or the gameplay book, but you would think that if she did, she wouldn&#39;t lose as much as she did🤔She took a lot of W&#39;s but there was a lot of L&#39;s too😂😂",2018-03-18T12:59:25Z
JazzyGuns,Jazzy I recommend you to learn some special moves from the move list. It makes the game 2 times more exciting and fun for you 👍🏻,2018-03-16T00:30:28Z
JazzyGuns,Shout out to Dwayne in the background getting them dubs,2019-10-30T06:13:42Z

JazzyGuns,This is a whole another level of obsession with Harley Quinn lol,2018-03-16T05:31:20Z
JazzyGuns,I know she doesn&#39;t like looking at toutorials but could she at least check the special moves because Supergirl is actually easy to play and zone with also she could find out what she is pressing that she doesn&#39;t like...or at least learn what the trait for each character is and she would avoid the grief she experienced with green lantern.,2018-03-16T01:34:08Z
JazzyGuns,"Not to mention Harley had to kill Joker because of Scarecrow. So yeah, the L &#39; s that she took",2018-07-20T19:25:39Z
JazzyGuns,Supergirl is probably the easiest character in the game to play and she&#39;s one of the best,2018-03-16T01:40:11Z
JazzyGuns,"Don&#39;t repeat moves and get closer to hit your opponents properly, because more you repeat a move, the less XP you earn and the more your opponents dodge your attacks",2020-07-06T07:03:58Z

JazzyGuns,I 100 percent agree with you about the release date issue!! They should’ve waited until they knew they were ready until pouring millions of dollars into promo and overhyping the audience... that just made people hella inpatient and eager for the game and lead to the buggy mess that it is 😭,2020-12-15T06:40:08Z
JazzyGuns,"Jazz you should know that CDPR had to answer their shareholders. So they tell their shareholders the release date etc. That information is public according to the laws and hence people get to know about the release dates too. And most probably, they would have delayed it more but their shareholders wanted to get it out coz of the Holiday season.",2020-12-15T05:23:22Z

LDShadowLady,when are you going to start uploading stuff for enchanted oasis? you&#39;re a part of that right?,2014-07-05T19:12:52Z
LDShadowLady,mosasaurus only eat squid i believe. and if they dont eat from the feeder hand feed them. click on their shadows with their desired food. and some of the dinos when full grown will break out of their cage if it isnt iron blocks/fence. hope this helped! (i watched cupquakes oasis season 1.) ,2014-07-05T22:23:29Z

LDShadowLady,"I think to make sure to don&#39;t get trapped in your base, you should set up a dispenser over the weighted pressure plate and be able to push a button and drop an item on it. I think that would be helpful. <br>~~~~~~<br>^~^",2016-01-29T19:40:55Z

Scouting ahead is pretty pointless since the threat only spawns when you get very close and then he often jumps round the corner and within a split second shoots a bullet straight into the ambassador&#39;s head... No way you could deal with that first attempt without knowing exactly where he&#39;s going to come from....",2018-10-01T20:51:35Z

stacyplays,"~ TIPS ON THE EXOTIC BIRDS MOD ~<br><br>for the unidentified egg, you will need to put it in a egg sorter (needs to be crafted) and then put the egg it, there is a chance you with either get an egg or eggshells.  you can also combine a bird&#39;s egg (ex: pigeon egg, magpie egg, etc) with blaze powder to increase the chances of spawning by 20%.  <br><br>if you kill a peacock and get it&#39;s feather and put it in the crafting table with a book, u can make a book of birds which tells you all the birds in the mod.  It starts off blank, so you will need to find the birds and left click them with the book to log them. This will reward you with xp.<br><br>for the phoenix bird, they can only be hatched with a light level of 9, 10, or 11.  you can craft a phoenix egg by surrounding phoenix dust around a regular egg in the crafting table.  phoenix dust are rarely found in abandoned mineshaft chests and extremely rare in bird nests.  adult phoenixes can be saddled and flown (look up to fly up and look down to fly down) when a phoenix dies, it drops another phoenix egg so you can rebirth another one.<br><br>magpies will occasionally &#39;scavenge&#39; and hold something in their mouth. You can retrieve this item by hitting them, but it will take a while for them to scavenge again, or be more kind and &#39;swap&#39; the item using wheat seeds.<br><br>owls will fly away if attacked. Their eyes glow in the dark.<br><br>parrots can be found in jungles. They can be tamed using wheat seeds and will follow you like wolves. You can also make them sit, walk or fly by right clicking them.<br><br>roadrunners you need to be holding wheat seeds to catch it&#39;s attention<br><br>that&#39;s all, thx and love you stacy!!",2016-08-20T01:34:43Z

stacyplays,The triceratops is tamed to you because you were so close when it hatcehd! Also right click it with your Dinopedia to see it&#39;s hunger and mood and what it eats. You should make it a toy ball to play with to make it&#39;s mood go up. Thumbs up so Stacy sees this comment!,2017-05-10T19:59:16Z
stacyplays,It needs to be two high and when you put down an egg you can right click it with the dinopedia and see how much it&#39;s hatched and also you need to make a Dino feeder for every dinosaur and add flowers etc into it  and place some grass and stuff in his cage ps: on shadow craft original Lizzie had dinosaurs so you could watch that for some help like so Stacy will see this!,2017-05-11T18:49:32Z

stacyplays,"STACY, <br>In the Primitive Mobs mod there is a mob called a treasure slime. You have come across this mob a few times. There is a special treasure slime that has a heart in it and it leaves heart particles. You can tame this slime by right clicking it. When you tame it, it changes from the colour white to black. You can change it&#39;s colour by using these dyes: Lapis,Cactus Green or Rose Red. You can change it&#39;s colour depending on how much dye you give it. You can also change it to other colours such as purple if you give it Rose Red and Lapis. You can sit it down and put it on your head by right (or left) clicking it or just let it follow you.<br>If you do get one, can you name it Jelly? If not, that&#39;s fine with me!😋<br>LIKE SO STACY CAN SEE! 🔮~🔮",2017-05-10T05:38:18Z

Niki Nihachu,I love how phil is just everyone&#39;s mod and i can just imagine him in a room with like 20 monitors looking after his children,2021-09-01T10:06:56Z
Niki Nihachu,it’s my favorite thing remembering that Phil is literally everybody’s mod like— Dadza is on the case,2021-08-29T14:16:07Z

Niki Nihachu,"What a day in DSMP history. Tubbo releasing his new song, Techno revealing he has cancer, Antfrosts birthday is today as of writing this comment, and now Niki uploaded.",2021-08-27T23:40:46Z
Niki Nihachu,I love how everyone turns into an English major for the unban requests,2021-09-12T14:50:27Z
Niki Nihachu,"I feel like if I ever got banned from somebody’s Twitch chat, they would have to read a four paragraph essay on:<br>-why I’m sorry for what I did<br>-Why I recognize it was wrong<br>-me explaining that I’m a fan<br>-Telling the mods that they’re doing an amazing job!<br>-Etc.",2021-08-31T01:55:09Z

Niki Nihachu,oh my god it is so refreshing to finally see a member of the dream smp explain that people shouldn&#39;t ship them if they&#39;re not comfortable with it. I hate people who ship random people together for absolutely no reason. Don&#39;t ship people you only see through a screen interacting with each other while making content. You have no idea what their actual chemistry with each other is in private.,2021-09-04T02:37:09Z
Niki Nihachu,no one:<br><br>Phil: &quot;KEEP EM BANNED”,2021-08-28T01:17:32Z
Niki Nihachu,"niki is literally my most favorite person, shes nice, and she talks about what she does and doesnt want during things like this.:DD",2021-08-27T23:40:15Z
Niki Nihachu,“Unban request”<br>Reminds me of when Tommy was exiled and he tried talk thru drista to dream and then drista mocks his accent 💀,2021-08-27T23:39:09Z
Niki Nihachu,Seing the way Niki stands up against these comments who objectify her makes me respect her more. <br><br>It can be really annoying being around those who don&#39;t see you as a person.,2021-09-08T20:01:35Z
Niki Nihachu,"it&#39;s the &quot;ur sexy&quot; shit that creeps me out the most. I mean yeah, she&#39;s pretty on the outside, but she&#39;s WAY more than her looks. Her soul is beautiful too. she&#39;s a nice, caring person, and i wish more people were like her. keep being amazing inside and out, Niki!",2021-08-28T06:34:04Z
Niki Nihachu,These people: [leaves their devices]<br><br>Their friends or family members: it&#39;s my time to shine,2021-09-03T16:56:28Z
Niki Nihachu,&quot;NOT SEXUALIZING I SWEAR!!!!&quot; their message: hey sexy babe,2021-08-27T23:43:05Z
Niki Nihachu,i really don’t understand why people don’t respect boundaries:((,2021-08-31T22:57:12Z
Niki Nihachu,i love that people are like &quot;oh yes lemme sexualize this streamer it&#39;ll be so cool&quot; and then are surprised when the streamer and their mods ban them,2021-08-28T00:25:06Z
Niki Nihachu,Nobody <br>Unban Requests be like : <b>My younger brother is the most evil being alive</b>,2021-09-03T04:37:41Z
Niki Nihachu,"I don’t know why so many people are so disrespectful to others. <br><br>But, I love how Phil had the decision, and he was just like, “KEEP EM BANNED”.<br>Edit: OMG, I JUST REALIZED I GOT 3.6K LIKES. THIS IS THE MOST LIKES I’VE EVER GOTTEN ON A COMMENT. TY!",2021-08-27T23:49:33Z
Niki Nihachu,I&#39;d honestly have more respect for them if they just owned up to it and apologized properly<br><br>The whole &quot;I didn&#39;t mean it like that&quot; or &quot;it was a joke I swear&quot; thing is really annoying when it&#39;s clear as day what their message meant,2021-09-02T22:00:58Z
Niki Nihachu,niki saying that she&#39;s uncomfortable with being called hot:<br>her chat:,2021-08-28T00:11:29Z
Niki Nihachu,When Nikki talks to her viewers it’s so awesome<br><br><br><br><br><br>but when the viewers talk back. . .,2021-08-27T23:54:18Z
Niki Nihachu,"Niki’s voice is just so calming, and seeing her post again, just lights up my day 💕",2021-08-28T00:47:58Z
Niki Nihachu,"Niki I just want to say that I really admire you. Even though most of those those messages were inappropriate, offensive and/or discouraging, you handled them all really well and kindly. It&#39;s really hard to be the amazing person you are even if you have all the support in the world, and if I were in your shoes, I would not have handled it as well as you did at all. Thank you for all the joy you give us, and keep it up!!!! :D",2021-09-08T14:33:29Z
Niki Nihachu,sadly i really wasn&#39;t surprised with all the &quot;she&#39;s hot&quot; messages. <br><br>its really unfortunate so many (mainly female) streamers have to see these things. <br>its not that hard just to keep those thoughts to yourself instead of saying them out loud.,2021-08-28T04:05:15Z
Niki Nihachu,philza has the ban hammer behind his back at all times when his friends stream its so funny,2021-09-07T20:50:13Z
Niki Nihachu,When Im getting chased by a murderer: fast<br>When Niki Posts: <b>LIGHT SPEED</b>,2021-08-27T23:40:47Z
Niki Nihachu,Niki: &quot;dont call anyone hot&quot;<br>The very second she switches to another one: &quot;hot girl stream&quot;,2021-09-01T22:30:37Z
Niki Nihachu,"the thing that makes me so sad is I feel like this happens way more frequently to female streamers, people just need to be decent humans and learn what you don&#39;t need to share, but im so glad that you are still able to make laugh about it and bring it to light and make it a more talked about topic &lt;3",2021-08-29T09:02:34Z
Niki Nihachu,"I feel like Phil is acting like such a father, and it’s so wholesome.",2022-10-02T00:27:44Z

Niki Nihachu,“it’s already asking for only fans” you say so casually,2021-08-27T23:38:02Z

Niki Nihachu,"I feel bad for the people who actually have bad family members that write those things, like I was one of those unban requests and my cousin is really mean but I should have known she wouldn’t believe me :c. Sorry Niki.",2021-08-27T23:57:03Z
Niki Nihachu,the fact that no matter what niki does she&#39;s always so adorable,2021-09-06T06:57:05Z
Niki Nihachu,Yeah because when I’m mad at my sibling my immediate response is “ah yes. Let’s go into Niki’s twitch chat and call her hot”<br>Like nah I feel like that’s not what happened…,2021-08-28T23:24:12Z
Niki Nihachu,I really love how Niki talks common sense into people when they say weird stuff to her,2022-01-20T04:52:35Z

Tell your oldest sister that her daughter will survive and be well.  Tell your second sister not to marry that perfect dude, he&#39;s a legit psychopath. Keep your family bonds strong. Keep your sisters together. Tell bro about his heart condition ASAP, it&#39;s more serious than it looks. Stay active. You&#39;ll get super rad at talking with strangers, it&#39;s totally true!

Don&#39;t worry, that&#39;ll help shape you as a person. You&#39;ll learn to become resilient but as a result become cynical. This&#39;ll force you to not socialise as much. But like earlier, don&#39;t worry, you meet people soon enough and evolve those basic relationships into who are today your best friends. You&#39;ll have to overcome many battles with yourself, questioning whether people really like you or will hate you after coming out. Just do it - these guys are your real friends; they won&#39;t see you any differently. Oh and about those goals, keep at&#39;em!

Dexbonus,"Dear past self:<br><br>There is so much more of the world to experience outside your tiny bubble - things to see, music to hear, people to meet, and knowledge to learn. Explore it, but don&#39;t latch on too tightly to things, habits, and people that hurt you. Keep an open mind, but stay true to who you are - your instincts won&#39;t steer you wrong. <br><br>Life will take you to all sorts of places, but you will make friends with people of all walks of life, even if you feel like an outsider at first. Don&#39;t look at disdain at those who don&#39;t fit the norm, because you will become one of them yourself. In fact, you will start to look at outsiders and misfits as your people, even though you will still find it easy to fit in with influential people who you thought of once as &quot;grown-ups&quot; rather than contemporaries who just happen to be older than you. <br><br>Fall in love slowly, not all at once, and with people as they are, not how you imagine them to be like. You will meet someone who will give you a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows. Love her, but don&#39;t let your experience with her overpower you or destroy who you are, and learn when to step away when things get rough. Things won&#39;t work out between you two in the end, but that spark that brought you together will make you inseparable friends. <br><br>Life is a struggle and you may become cynical and jaded, but summon the courage to give your aspirations and dreams your best shot. You may be pleasantly surprised and have fewer regrets later, and whatever happens, even if it seems like the end of the world, you will get through knowing that you tried. <br><br>And to my future self: <br><br>I hope everything works out for you in the end. I&#39;m sorry for continuously putting off work and forcing you to hurry and rush through everything, but I know you will understand. I wonder where you are, who you&#39;re with, what you&#39;re doing, and what you&#39;re interested in, but I&#39;m sure they are similar to how they are for me now. Have you written that story I&#39;ve wanted to write? I wonder what you would say to my present self, once I become my past self. I hope they are good things. ",2015-03-05T11:24:36Z

It&#39;s a question ultimately about regrets, and if you&#39;re genuinely happy about where you are in life (and I believe you probably are) then it totally makes sense to advise yourself in this way.<br><br>But if you do have regrets, and you&#39;re not happy as you are, then do you think it would be worthwhile to advise your past self on how to deal with the events differently, and to turn your regrets around?

Dexbonus,I took Latin because my high school had the coolest Latin program ever. We had chariot races every semester where teams of two would build chariots and then race. My friend and I made the mistake of creating our chariot out of blocks of wood so it weighed a crapload. Most people just watched it for the crashes though. We also had gladiator games which were pretty awesome. Only time you could ever wrestle/joust a teacher without getting in trouble.,2012-01-03T08:58:41Z
Dexbonus,"Best way to deal with burns: Either hold something metal on the burn (it conducts the heat from your burn to the steel) or put spiders web on it! I&#39;ve got no idea why the spider web thing works, but it stops the pain.

To make it more ridiculous, this burner was cold and I was save, but I obviously had to try the other one too, which burned my fingers. :-D",2012-05-16T19:51:50Z

Sqaishey Quack,"TBH Sqaishey, you are totally minecraft noob. You need more experience in the new 1.8 update and even about the things before that.<br><br>-You can get nametags to name your seperate dogs and animals. But you can only name a villager as a &#39;baby.&#39;<br>--You click on an adult villager with a spawn egg and comes out a baby one. You can&#39;t name an adult villager because it opens up the trading menu. <br>-Middle click the scrolly thing on your mouse while pointing at an object. Whatever block you were looking at will be duplicated in your item bar. Only in creative mode. <br>--You can also middle click when your cursor is over an item in a chest or inventory and you will duplicate it. You can continuously create more banners<br>-You can&#39;t put rose bushes, lilacs, &amp; peonies in flower pots because they are the tall, huge flowers that take up 2 blocks (tall). Although there are similar, smaller flowers such as poppies that you can put into flower pots. <br>-You can get colored banners and decorate them in a crafting table. The different designs include crosses, straight lines, circles, etc. And you can overlap basic designs to create one huge one, such as a Sqaishey Banner.<br>-Sea Lanterns are a good alternative to glowstone. They just look better (personally) and they give off the sound of the ocean when you get close to them. They are found in sea temples.<br>-It doesn&#39;t seem like people can actually open chests in other people&#39;s plots, at least not in this server. When you said that somebody took one of the banners, that somebody was yourself<br>-Even if people could open chests, an ender chest is exclusive to each person so nobody can get your stuff and they will end up accessing their own things they have once put in an enderchest at one point on the server.<br>- Acacia wood is pronounced <b>&#39;A-kay-shia&#39;</b> <b>not</b> &#39;A-kak-ia or &#39;a-cha-chia&#39;<br>-Stairs automatically &#39;turn&#39; to merge with a stair next to it facing a different orientation. Try it. Place a stair one direction, and place another stair next to it in a different direction and notice how they merge. But do not place the stair facing the opposite direction. It won&#39;t work if you do that. This stair turning is useful for creating roofing and the illusion of a sofa. There is no need to put signs as hand-rests. <br>-Put glow stone or sea lanterns underneath water, behind stairs, leaves, under carpets, behind paintings and banners as well as under chests. Gives off hidden lighting <br>-You can rename items in an anvil<br>-You can use an enchanted book to enchant armour, weapons and tools with a chosen and specific enchantment type. <br>-The use of colored glass can do wonders, Sqaishey! <br>-<b>You can tame bunnies using carrots.</b> They act the same way as ocelots. Once they are tames, they cannot be made to sit down. Nothing with they&#39;re appearance changes. <br>-Use a normal chest instead of a trapped chest. The server allows people to steal from and open chests on other people&#39;s plot. The difference is...there is none! It&#39;s just that you can place chests and trap chests directly next to each other without them merging. You know how you cannot put a chest block next to a double chest? You can put a trap chest next to it and it has the same functionality.  ",2015-02-17T12:04:20Z

KittyKatGaming,Really should invest in a controller. The platforming gets out of control later. I see Arin&#39;s Mario 64 type rage in the near future. It&#39;s gonna be awsome.,2015-09-14T17:53:58Z
KittyKatGaming,You are going to get really mad with the bosses in the Mad Hatter part; upgrade your weapons as much as possible to defeat those annoying bosses!,2015-09-14T17:18:42Z
KittyKatGaming,also this is one of those games you should take your time and look around for stuff and just really pay attention and try to remember what you&#39;re told (the chalkboard lessons and cheshire are especially important) because they give hints or just straight up tell you what to do,2015-09-14T17:20:49Z
KittyKatGaming,i really suggest headphones or something so you can turn up the volume because this game has a lot of pig snouts that will really help you and a lot of times they&#39;re hidden some are even invisible and you just really have to listen of them and follow the noise,2015-09-14T17:12:02Z
KittyKatGaming,"Helpful tips for this game ahead! Woo! (Double post from your previous video, sorry!)<br><br>You can use the Pepper Grinder to shoot enemies at long range! Use it against the bolterfly hives/hard to reach enemies (it&#39;s also just a generally good weapon, so make sure you use it for more than just the pig snouts).<br><br>Using a controller will help you IMMENSELY. I would ask Ross how to hook up an Xbox 360 controller to your PC so you can play without frustration (I assume he often uses controllers to play his PC games on Steam Train) . The controls are much easier to use with a controller rather than a mouse and keyboard, and you&#39;ll definitely enjoy the game when you can move around the world better.<br><br>Remember to lock on to enemies! If you&#39;re going to continue using a mouse and keyboard, it&#39;s the Caps Lock button, but if you&#39;re going to start using an Xbox 360 controller it&#39;s Left Trigger. Also, DODGING IS YOUR BEST FRIEND :D<br><br>You can upgrade your weapons with the teeth you collect in your menu! Pause and go to the weapons menu when you have enough teeth to upgrade your weapons. Collect as many teeth as you can and you can upgrade your weapons quicker!<br><br>I hope this helps you a bit! I LOOOOVED playing this game, and I hope you see these tips so you can enjoy it as much as I did :D",2015-09-15T12:25:25Z

KittyKatGaming,"I made an assumption that Suzy had more platformer games experience, but I think I know better now. Try timing your jumps by using as few jumps as possible, her mechanics work kinda like Princess Peach in 3D world.",2015-09-19T17:02:08Z

KittyKatGaming,Use a controller suzy it will be easier to play the game that way :),2015-09-14T22:29:44Z
KittyKatGaming,am I the only one that thinks the gooey dolls look like baby twin victims? just me? ok then,2016-01-06T19:21:47Z
KittyKatGaming,"I think you may find this game easier if you use a controller instead of Mouse/keyboard. Usually I prefer mouse and keyboard too but this game was much easier to use a controller with. Just some food for thought, you seem to be having some camera issues.",2015-09-15T07:18:09Z
KittyKatGaming,"Y&#39;know, watching Suzy play this just now, I was thinking &quot;this looks unfun compared to, like... Batman.&quot; But then I realized Batman&#39;s a pretty sexist game series, depicting its women as sexual objects and/or victims (which natural flows from the franchise itself).<br>So then I was like &quot;but wait, other devs have used the fun Arkham combat to make games.&quot; But then I realized that Shadow of Mordor has basically no women in it and I&#39;ve heard (but can&#39;t speak to it myself) that Mad Max is mildly sexist too.<br><br>So, that&#39;s kinda weird, isn&#39;t it? I think they&#39;re all published by Warner Bros., so maybe that&#39;s just a thing about WB. Anyway, I guess I still hope Suzy will play one of those games sometime. This one seems lackluster. At least the art&#39;s good.",2015-09-14T22:36:45Z
KittyKatGaming,I know everyone else has already told you this but you should get a controller,2015-09-14T18:15:39Z
KittyKatGaming,I like watching this but you need to lighten the screen up a little its really dark and hard to see things.,2015-09-14T18:25:03Z

KittyKatGaming,&quot;This is still tutorial stuff&quot; because you take too long to advance..<br><br>&quot;Why is this so hard&quot; it&#39;s not. Your using a keyboard when you should be using a controller.,2016-02-24T14:10:26Z

KittyKatGaming,Misha&#39;s deal is that she&#39;s slow. I like that the game shows people with disabilities can still have skills. Just because Misha is slow doesn&#39;t mean she can&#39;t learn sign language.,2018-01-01T06:21:37Z

KittyKatGaming,"I knew this game was cathartic to play. I didn&#39;t realize how cathartic it was to watch others play.<br><br>In New Leaf, specifically, there&#39;s always one genuine piece of art and 3 fake ones in Redd&#39;s Gallery. There are certain characteristics you have to look for. There are guides online that explain the differences between a fake work and a real one, so you don&#39;t have to waste your money. Still, it does tend to take a long time to collect everything, especially when he keeps displaying the same piece you already have in your museum, like, 50 times.",2015-03-24T16:19:42Z
KittyKatGaming,It is possible to tell the fake paintings from the real ones by comparing each painting to the design in real life. I think it&#39;s always three fakes and one real,2015-03-23T19:59:28Z
KittyKatGaming,So ive been a fan of mortem3r and the grumps for a long time now and both have gotten me through really rough times like whats going on now because im losing alot of family and i just wanted to say thank you suzy and thank you barry ross arin and danny youve all gotten me through the worst depression ever &lt;3 ya,2015-03-23T21:46:15Z

KittyKatGaming,Wire wrap or macrame is a nice setting. If you are very careful you might be able to sand a channel around the edge for the wire or cord to sit in.<br>Also they recently found amber that contains part of an ancient carnivorous plant which is pretty cool. Amber is awesome :),2015-03-24T22:03:25Z

KittyKatGaming,"I know I&#39;m way late to the party, but if you&#39;re still looking for ways to make jewelry out of the amber you could try wrapping a strip of some kind of metal around the stone and fastening with a glue or something :)",2016-09-22T03:30:47Z
KittyKatGaming,About the amber jewelry. You could maybe wire wrap them depending on how brittle they are. I&#39;ve done it with larger tumbled crystals and once you got the hang of it the pieces can be quite pretty.,2015-06-16T06:07:31Z
KittyKatGaming,"Amber jewelry...sounds interesting. Maybe have a casing that goes around it? Something like two halves of a brooch, with the front having an opening the amber fits into without damaging it connecting both sides with small screws on the side.<br>sounds like a lot of work with customizing the metal for every piece of amber, though.",2015-03-23T23:24:47Z

KittyKatGaming,On the amber jewelry note you could try to make a small metal case to put it into (like a ring around it or something) that you tighten after putting it in to secure it and have it still completely visible and attachable to necklaces and stuff,2015-03-26T08:38:14Z

KittyKatGaming,"Suzy, we like watching your games. My name is Luna. They&#39;re really fun choices and I came up with some ideas for your amber jewelry.

I can&#39;t wait to see more videos of animal crossing :D",2015-03-23T20:28:42Z

That sounded so good. Like, that&#39;s the kind of singing I like but can&#39;t come by very often, the kind that is a strong, solid, flowing voice that is also smooth. My favorite is when it&#39;s a female singer but I gotta give you props on that one man. Sick vocal belt.",2016-02-01T03:47:51Z

KittyKatGaming,"I like Suzi&#39;s ending slate. The opening one, while well animated and looks really nice, is a bit too intense to be a daily show thing that I&#39;m going to watch a thousand times. I usually end up skipping over it after I&#39;ve seen it 20 or so times.",2016-02-01T03:56:04Z

KittyKatGaming,am i the only one who think&#39;s it&#39;s absolutely hilarious that this game expects you to shout &quot;I LOVE YOU!&quot; at the DS. especially since it&#39;d likely be in a public place where you&#39;d normally play a DS,2016-05-25T00:37:09Z

KittyKatGaming,I can see why you don&#39;t like Scorpions! I moved to Arizona a couple days before Christmas 2015 and I kept catching those little bastards with salad tongs and putting them in a mason jar.

KittyKatGaming,"Man, I have learned so much about whales by from diving (heh) into the comments section of this episode.

All in all, a very interesting night.",2016-09-22T09:52:23Z
KittyKatGaming,"those whales you couldn&#39;t identify are called Cachalot  (cash-uh-low), or more commonly known as Sperm Whales.

KittyKatGaming,I&#39;ve been electro-shocked (with the brrbrbrbrbrbrbrbbr effect and all). It doesn&#39;t feel as nice as you hope! It&#39;s more like what you might think a heart attack feels like. Although I think it&#39;s made me more sensitive to magnetics/electricity.,2016-09-20T09:26:21Z

KittyKatGaming,"These games are SUPER easy to &quot;cheat&quot; at if you cross your eyes so the images overlap. A friend of mine made a series of games just titled &quot;4 Differences,&quot; &quot;5 differences,&quot; and &quot;6 Differences.&quot; He knew about the eye-crossing trick, so one of them (4 Differences, I believe) uses mirror images to prevent that from working.",2015-09-02T18:08:15Z
