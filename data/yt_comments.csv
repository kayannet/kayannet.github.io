MrBeast Gaming,Watching Jimmy rage is the funniest thing I&#39;ve ever seen &quot;Boo hoo I&#39;ve had that happen to me for 4 maps&quot;
MrBeast Gaming,Jimmy is a really sweat and funny guy… but seeing him laying a big one on a sock was so grate considering what he has done as pranks to his friends both destroying and giving away their cars costing them money but he still is an awesome generous guy and he dose it out of love you rock guys
MrBeast Gaming,"Jimmy Raging<br>Jimmy, otherwise known as MrBeast, finally sees what raining arrows looks like in Minecraft. But little does he know that he will soon be raging so hard because of it."
MrBeast Gaming,love the way how hard jimmy rages when he looses in anything
MrBeast Gaming,Chandler lost so many challenges but he never lost himself
MrBeast Gaming,Jimmy raging is one of the rarest things we will ever see in our entire lives
MrBeast Gaming,Finally Jimmy felt what losing was like.
MrBeast Gaming,I love that in every obstacle course where there are two people are great while the other two suffer and always  jimmy is part of those 😂
MrBeast Gaming,I like how Jimmy is all Confident at the start then he loses lol
MrBeast Gaming,I love how Karl doesn’t even get mad when Jimmy killed him at the last stage
MrBeast Gaming,It’s kinda rare to see jimmy lose a challenge
MrBeast Gaming,Chris: brags that he hasn’t died<br><br>Karma: hold my drink.
MrBeast Gaming,Chris: You have to keep moving. Jimmy: <b>Stops moving</b>
MrBeast Gaming,"Man of his word, much respect MrBeast"
MrBeast Gaming,jimmy raging is the most rare thing to see
MrBeast Gaming,I love how Jimmy was raging so hard.
MrBeast Gaming,The video should of been called “rare footage of MrBeast raging”.
MrBeast Gaming,"&quot;Karl&#39;s a genius&quot; - Jimmy 2020 <br><br>Karl, never forget that Jimmy once said this"
MrBeast Gaming,this is why jimmy stays in creative 😂
MrBeast Gaming,Anyone see how jimmy silently rages in his mind? Hehe
MrBeast Gaming,Jimmy : kill somebody<br><br>Karl : <b>M O A N S</b>
MrBeast Gaming,the fact Jimmy rage quit is something ya dont see every day
MrBeast Gaming,Alternate Title: Jimmy gets mad at arrows while Chris laughs at his misfortune.
MrBeast Gaming,I&#39;ve been literally spending my winter break watching MrBeast videos
MrBeast Gaming,This backfired so badly for Jimmy 🤣
MrBeast Gaming,Who builds these maps for you? The maps look so beautiful. I wish I had someone to build maps for me!
MrBeast Gaming,is it just me or is it crazy that in just 1 year jimmy got about 20 mil subscribers?
MrBeast Gaming,"After watching both this video and the Netherite one back-to-back, I figured out they use the exact same punishment."
MrBeast Gaming,Alternative title: Jimmy getting a Taste of his own Medicine.
MrBeast Gaming,"I like how at the first course, the super Mario 64 music immediately stops when Chris gets hit 😂"
MrBeast Gaming,I live how unenthusiastic chandler is whenever someone makes it to the end (mostly mr beast)
MrBeast Gaming,we all need a friend like chris
MrBeast Gaming,Jimmy&#39;s smile in the thumbnail never gets old
MrBeast Gaming,Chris And chandler pissing jimmy off is the most funniest thing i&#39;ve ever seen
MrBeast Gaming,"I don’t know why, but seeing jimmy mad just brings a smile to my face."
MrBeast Gaming,No one: <br>Not even my dog: <br>Not even the ender dragon:<br>Jimmy: <b>casually sweating when it’s raining</b>
MrBeast Gaming,Mr:beast: let me know if somebody still has steak<br>Chandler: <b>has his camera blocking the first 3 slot pieces</b>
MrBeast Gaming,Imagine if they did this while trying to beat the game
MrBeast Gaming,"Chris: It&#39;s not luck, I&#39;m dodging the arrows <br>*gets hit by an arrow as he&#39;s saying it"
MrBeast Gaming,"First Time Hearing Jimmy Say Swear Word, But Still A Legend Tho"
MrBeast Gaming,Now we know the real reason why Jimmy hasn’t been participating in the events<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>He is even worse than Chandler</b>
MrBeast Gaming,The fact Chris swore and the editor just edits it out
MrBeast Gaming,Alternate title: rare footage of Jimmy raging
MrBeast Gaming,MrBeast need to do a $100.000 Minecraft tournament just like he did with Among Us
MrBeast Gaming,MrBeast the type of guy to clean the vents in among us..
MrBeast Gaming,It’s crazy how much minecraft has changed over the years.
MrBeast Gaming,I remember the first time I played Minecraft in 2011.  I was at a babysitters house and the older kids would let me play on their worlds.  Crazy how different it is now.
MrBeast Gaming,Alpha 1.2.6 was my favorite version back in 2010. I have a lot of great memories when Minecraft was actually a challenging and simple game.
MrBeast Gaming,Jimmy: It&#39;s so old that you don&#39;t even need to eat<br>Chris: Let&#39;s go get some food!
MrBeast Gaming,"the nostalgia of this version is real, i remember playing the very first version of minecraft on the xbox 360 in the tutorial world and just how much fun it was, back when finding diamonds was exciting"
MrBeast Gaming,"When it was actually scary when it got dark, and creepers were actually deadly. And I still wish this was the health system, hunger bar has always been terribly designed. Also this isn&#39;t the oldest, this is right before the beta version, but the biggest milestones in this game have been Alpha 1.2.6, Beta 1.7.3 and 1.0.0"
MrBeast Gaming,Chris: It’s time to mine<br><br>Also Chris: <b>*proceeds to make a wooden shovel*</b>
MrBeast Gaming,"Ah yes oldest minecraft version Alpha 1.2.6.<br><br>Edit: Im pretty sure Alpha is the oldest version that works like normal Minecraft. Because there was versions before Alpha like Infdev, Indev, Classic and the oldest version Preclassic. But all of these versions are really different. Preclassic is just a flat platform Where you are stuck in creative mode and Can only Place and break Blocks. Same for classic But it had hills and there is 1 mob. And Indev and Infdev are basicly versions Where Notch tests the games limits."
MrBeast Gaming,"Chandler- ooh! I found coal!<br><br>Jimmy, Karl, Chris- completely ignore Chandler."
MrBeast Gaming,imagine if multiplayer existed on the actual FIRST first version of minecraft
MrBeast Gaming,Fun fact: This minecraft version is older than most of the fortnite players.
MrBeast Gaming,"I remember I used to like, make a house out of wool and then light it up on fire in this version. I still do it in the newest version tho 😂"
MrBeast Gaming,Chandler: screams at the top of his lounges when he found diamonds<br><br>Karl:ThAtS a FoUr VeIn ThAtS a FoUr VeIn ThAtS a FoUr VeIn<br><br>Both of them completely screaming when the found out it’s a six vein
MrBeast Gaming,It definitely isn&#39;t the oldest version (the oldest publicly available version being Pre-Classic rd-132211) but still cool to watch nonetheless.
MrBeast Gaming,this makes me so proud to see how far Minecraft has come and how fun and confusing it was when it came out.
MrBeast Gaming,I&#39;ve been playing this same version. Any idea how to go to the nether in multiplayer? The portal wouldn&#39;t teleport me for some reason. works fine in singleplayer
MrBeast Gaming,"MrBeast: “it’s so old there’s no hunger bar,”<br><br>Everyone: “We need food,”"
MrBeast Gaming,I love how Chris said it&#39;s time to mine and it looked like he was crafting a shovel🤣
MrBeast Gaming,I love how Jimmy&#39;s the only one that can&#39;t see tools and other players periodically  (:
MrBeast Gaming,can we just address the fact that chris is mining iron ore with a wooden pickaxe.
MrBeast Gaming,Don’t you love how Chris mines iron with a wood pickaxe
MrBeast Gaming,actually the first version was cave game it was just a square piece of land made of grass and cobblestone and you couldn&#39;t see your character take damage sprint or jump and there was no mobs the only thing in the game was grass and cobblestone and the only game mechanics was walking around and destroying and placing blocks which was just grass and cobblestone
MrBeast Gaming,"Imagine if they actually played the first version where everything is flat, now that would be content"
MrBeast Gaming,Karl’s British accent is so good   Karl : I cant wait to find dimonds
MrBeast Gaming,Everybody laughs when Chris rages over realistic water
MrBeast Gaming,I love how Carl can&#39;t  drag click
MrBeast Gaming,Every mrbeast video is amazing no matter if it&#39;s on his main channel or not
MrBeast Gaming,"The amount of money I would have paid, for them going through all that struggle to find diamonds and get hyped up for a battle in the nether just for the portal to not light 😂😂😂"
MrBeast Gaming,"fun fact: this isnt actually the oldest version of minecraft, this is the first version that had multiplayer"
MrBeast Gaming,"Technically in the oldest version, u r spawned in a flat grass world, i think u can break blocks and place cobblestone but thats about it"
MrBeast Gaming,This is literally the only version I’ve played and this video made sm more sense than the videos of the new versions 😂
MrBeast Gaming,Fun fact:The Alpha version has no skins other than the Steve skin.
MrBeast Gaming,"If the nether existed, you aren&#39;t in the oldest update (pre-classic would be the oldest). But at the same time, it would&#39;ve been a boring video if Mrbeast and the gang were playing that old Minecraft"
MrBeast Gaming,It&#39;s funny how they&#39;re just trying to get food without a hunger bar
MrBeast Gaming,&quot;there&#39;s not even a food bar&quot;<br><br>I remember having the exact opposite reaction
MrBeast Gaming,This was the version of minecraft I played and quit instantly lol Maybe it&#39;s time to revisit after all these years
MrBeast Gaming,"If you see a health bar, it&#39;s definitely not the first ever version of Minecraft."
MrBeast Gaming,"I played Minecraft in 2015 still do it was my first ever XBOX one game, The textures, features, and the game itself with the new mobs and crap have changed so much over the past 13 years"
MrBeast Gaming,Fun fact: that actually isn&#39;t the first version. I have played classic and it is so much different. However this is the first survival Minecraft ever created.
MrBeast Gaming,Fun fact: In Minecraft Java Alpha 1.2.2 till Alpha 1.2.7 you could spawn nether portals by pressing F4 or Ctrl F4.
MrBeast Gaming,Chris has a kid<br>Chandler has a dog <br>Jimmy has a girlfriend<br>Karl you have us
MrBeast Gaming,Chandler and Karl are great friends :D
MrBeast Gaming,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9C6t_nNouY&amp;t=7m32s"">7:32</a> all of their responses to the “thinking” sequence were immaculate😂😂😂"
MrBeast Gaming,"The oldest Version is actually Pre-Classic (almost unplayable)<br>But, The Oldest Completely Playable version is Indev"
MrBeast Gaming,"I actually remember my first time playing Minecraft is when there was only red beds, no hunger bar, and you couldn&#39;t equip items on your offhand."
MrBeast Gaming,I like that chris started mining iron with a wooden pickaxe.
MrBeast Gaming,Karl: i have no girlfriend <br>All female Karl fans: allow us to introduce ourselves
MrBeast Gaming,"Chandler finds diamonds.<br>Jimmy gives him one job: &quot;Promise me you won&#39;t die with those diamonds&quot;<br>Chandler Mind - Crap, biggest responsibility."

MrBeast Gaming,I know that guy wanted to see his family but that kitchen build was way better imo
MrBeast Gaming,I love how consistent and yet so different every episode is:
MrBeast Gaming,I love how almost none of the objects were judged on how well they were built
MrBeast Gaming,"Bruh that kitchen guy deserved more. Fantastic build, outstanding detail"
MrBeast Gaming,imagine putting your heart and soul into building something for a chance to win just to be hit with &quot;i dont get it&quot; &quot;i cant buy that&quot;
MrBeast Gaming,mrbeast always brightening the day
MrBeast Gaming,"Ngl, if I got the $10 I probably would have made a Big Mac"
MrBeast Gaming,love how much energy they have when making videos for the world
MrBeast Gaming,"I love your videos, man! You truly are an angel straight from heaven. You give so much. My family is going through a rough patch with money, but I&#39;m glad I can still watch your videos. It makes me happy to see you help others."
MrBeast Gaming,jimmy is actually the best content crator in history so far
MrBeast Gaming,I feel happy for the person that is gonna go see his family
MrBeast Gaming,"He’s gonna need another 50k to finish the throne, lol, i’m betting you anything it’s more like a footstool."
MrBeast Gaming,"I feel so bad for the person who built the Mario, especially when you look at who they lost to 😭"
MrBeast Gaming,"Need more of these!!!!! Great content, and keep up the great work 👍"
MrBeast Gaming,These are fantastic builds I love them
MrBeast Gaming,and im so happy to see you spread love and help people out
MrBeast Gaming,Isn’t the guy building the 13k pound drum of barbecue sauce from Family Friendly?
MrBeast Gaming,Swifts toilet was a master piece
MrBeast Gaming,I love how he makes games for all of us 😍😍😍😍😍😍
MrBeast Gaming,The best thing about this KN episode was how diverse it was. You had a Mexican chef cooking Chinese food in an Italian restaurant.
MrBeast Gaming,I&#39;m kinda sad we don&#39;t get to see the finished throne of money
MrBeast Gaming,Damn I actually wanted the Kitchen guy to win those ingredients
MrBeast Gaming,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvYkeTmM1gc&amp;t=4m54s"">4:54</a><br>Chandler&#39;s an absolute BOSS, love the guy"
MrBeast Gaming,"This is a great way to end this year. Hope to see more content in 2023 Jimmy, keep it up"

MrBeast Gaming,Never let them know your next move. &quot;Builds the world&quot;
MrBeast Gaming,i love how when he does comedy he makes people laugh but then the people who were competing get a zero lol
MrBeast Gaming,I hope some day I get selected to be in a Mr. Beast contest that would be awesome
MrBeast Gaming,Now I want to see that throne.
MrBeast Gaming,A youtuber more philanthropic than any non-profit... What a time to be alive!
MrBeast Gaming,Honestly who couldn’t love mr beast always changing someone’s life❤
MrBeast Gaming,I felt bad for the one man 0 on the 5 grand😂😂😂
MrBeast Gaming,I wanna see you guys build something. The boys should compete with each other.
MrBeast Gaming,"What a cool game, if I had gotten the 25,000 one I would have chosen a small car to be able to transport myself to work hahaha"
MrBeast Gaming,"Happy new years, Mrbeast and crew! I know that you&#39;ll go to even bigger heights in 2023!"
MrBeast Gaming,It&#39;s people like you who made me start streaming gaming. Keep it up bro! Awesome dude
MrBeast Gaming,"This man always tries to do something new and extra ordinary and make his audience feel excited for every next, video love you"
MrBeast Gaming,Imagine you were in this challenging you got the $10 zone and you won I’d be very disappointed because I won $10 instead of 1500
MrBeast Gaming,Hey whats up love the content its very uplifting to see everything you do keep it up
MrBeast Gaming,The Twitter comment guy was so sure of himself 😂😭 surprise🎉
MrBeast Gaming,Imagine finally getting into a mr beast Minecraft challenge only to get the 10 dollar prize 💀💀💀
MrBeast Gaming,Imagine having the best build in the 10 dollar plot 💀
MrBeast Gaming,Keep up the good deeds man wish I could do the things you do for people
MrBeast Gaming,Aun esta disponible el servidor?
MrBeast Gaming,"Imagine wanting a diamond, so you make scenery around said diamond, but Jimmy doesn’t understand it 😂😂😂"
MrBeast Gaming,"Start playing Genshin Impact 2.1 HERE: <a href=""https://mhy.link/9fa2IXA6"">https://mhy.link/9fa2IXA6</a>"
MrBeast Gaming,it&#39;s so nice to see that many TNTs explode without laggs 😂
MrBeast Gaming,I would like to thank the editors for the great edits they put into These videos and the great effort they put into these videos
MrBeast Gaming,I love how he gets straight to the point and NO click bait its like he can&#39;t be real
MrBeast Gaming,"The first problem pretty much proves the Monte Carlo paradox. After the first door’s reveal, the other door he didn’t pick had a 66% chance of having the higher rewadd"
MrBeast Gaming,It’s funny how Nolan says “that hurts” when he loses 10 k but he has lost an island lol
MrBeast Gaming,"&quot;Now its the perfect time to play Genshin Impact as they are celebrating their 1 year anniversery&quot; <br><br>Me: Oh dear, looks like Jimmy isnt too kept up to date with what is happening now with Genshin&#39;s first anniversery."
MrBeast Gaming,I love how zooms was like “pretty easy” like he did something but Karl’s friends messed him up
MrBeast Gaming,Can we all just take a moment to recognise all the time and effort the editors put into these videos
MrBeast Gaming,Let’s all just salute the fact that Mango was such a good sport
MrBeast Gaming,The funniest thing is Karl taking hit with Zhongli in Genshin Impact gameplay 😂😂😂😂😂. Like dude he is the best Shielder in the game 😂😂
MrBeast Gaming,"I respect everyone who were involved in this, Seriously the best piece that I&#39; ve ever seen on YouTube,HATS OFF TO WELL ALL ! LOVE YOUR VIDEO......."
MrBeast Gaming,Crazy to think about how much development &amp; building goes behind these minecraft videos.
MrBeast Gaming,The fact that he still gave her 1k even tho she lost <br>he deserves this:👑
MrBeast Gaming,"It&#39;s so crazy you give out so much money even if they lose the challenge big respect to you Jimmy honestly.<br>You have the kid 1k just because you felt bad for him with that 1k I would be able to pay all my debt that I have and he just got it for a petty try thats crazy.<br>Keep up the quality content Jimmy, love the videos."
MrBeast Gaming,Man mr beast is so sweet even if someone fails the challenge he will still give them money
MrBeast Gaming,"MrBeast is the only person to have no intro, no outro and 100% of the video is pure content. Now all I need is a Beast Burger in Aus."
MrBeast Gaming,I used to love the main channel more than the gaming channel but recently i’ve started to really enjoy watching the gaming channel it’s so entertaining
MrBeast Gaming,"Hey Jimmy, even though you won&#39;t see this, I wanted to say thanks so much for all your generosity and kindness doing these challenges, and even though ill probably never be in one they&#39;re still great to watch &lt;3"
MrBeast Gaming,Primo Geovishap is more of a mini-boss than a boss. Still it&#39;s pretty cool to see Chris and Karl play Genshin Impact.
MrBeast Gaming,"Hey I love your videos. They are very entertaining to watch, keep up the great work and positivity!"
MrBeast Gaming,"I love the reaction on everyone’s face when they just won $10,000 its crazy"
MrBeast Gaming,it hurts to see karl use zhongli but deals little to no damage
MrBeast Gaming,"MrBeast always has so good ideas even in Minecraft, the videos are always so entertaining"
MrBeast Gaming,I love how MrBeast also gives the losers a monetary reward so they don&#39;t feel bad.
MrBeast Gaming,I love how mr. beast just give them money even if they lose the challenge❤️💙💛❤️💛💙
MrBeast Gaming,I love that the only good character they used to beat the Primo Geovishap is Zhongli.
MrBeast Gaming,Damn. I wanna play co-op with them on Genshin &lt;3
MrBeast Gaming,"I love the first dudes vibe, “more than I started with!!!”"
MrBeast Gaming,"For anyone curios, genshin&#39;s anniversary basically has the entire community getting mad at mihoyo and review bombing them due to the underwhelming anniversary rewards and events that they gave. Some also argue that mihoyo has had barely any communication with the community this past year and barely listened to them, which is the real reason why the community is mad."
MrBeast Gaming,"I love Nolan, he&#39;s hilarious and I love his voice. He should be in more videos"
MrBeast Gaming,“The hardest boss on genshin impact.”<br><b>cut to Chris and Karl beating it’s ass</b>
MrBeast Gaming,"After they revealed the yellow door had 0, there was a 66% chance that the red door had 10k"
MrBeast Gaming,House burning down part<br><br>Jimmy: “How did this fire get down here Karl?”<br>Karl: “I don’t know it’s kind of bad though.”<br>Chris: “Karl is just a meanie.”<br>Me: “Karl sabotages.”
MrBeast Gaming,This man either ruins everyone’s hopes and dreams or makes them come true
MrBeast Gaming,I’m glad ish won his Prius. He’s one of my favorite recurring characters on the channel
MrBeast Gaming,"As a f2p player in genshin, I am surprised  that chris and karl got actual 5* characters, zhongli especially (my hu tao and xiao crying)"
MrBeast Gaming,Chris and Karl probably haven&#39;t finished the Quests yet and that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t fight the Frog or The Dead Woman and we can see that they really are new to the game because My Diluc&#39;s Normal dmg is 8k without buff or no skills just normal basic attack.<br>Play the game but if you&#39;re a speed runner I believe you wouldn&#39;t love the game
MrBeast Gaming,they’re both geovishops but azdaha is harder than the primo geovishop
MrBeast Gaming,He should do a maze challenge with five teams but Someone in your own team will be sabotaging against you in order so they can move forward quicker
MrBeast Gaming,Crazy to think Karl’s still a goofy
MrBeast Gaming,Seeing Karl and Chris playing Genshin makes me happy
MrBeast Gaming,The one thing that is scarier than the tires rolling down on you: the fact that the tires are circle
MrBeast Gaming,Waiting patiently for new videos MrBeast... It&#39;s the only channel worth watching whole day every day...
MrBeast Gaming,Even at the time the primo geovishap wasn’t the hardest boss 😂😂
MrBeast Gaming,"It’s funny how Karl’s meant to be good but didn’t kill the contestant with a sword, and Karl died by fall damage."
MrBeast Gaming,Is no one gonna talk about how he called the primo gevioshap one of the hardest bosses in game 😭<br><br>Someone hasn&#39;t seen Azhdaha<br><br>WAIT NO RAIDEN YOU HAVEN&#39;T SEEN THE WEEKLY RAIDEN THAT&#39;S A PAIN IN THE ASS<br><br>I&#39;d get that 10k pretty quickly if I was doing it lmao
MrBeast Gaming,It was so satisfying when the dude escaped from Karl and won $10k I was rooting for him 😂
MrBeast Gaming,I love how my mans karl n chris are literally programmed robots in the sponsorship thingies
MrBeast Gaming,Sería bueno que mr. Beast tenga un canal de mr. Beast gaming en español ya que de seguro hay mucha gente que desea ver a mr. Beast jugar sin tener que utilizar subtitulos
MrBeast Gaming,I love how everyone is trying to get the high IQ plays and Lazar is jus having fun
MrBeast Gaming,Dream: Immediatly kills in front of Dani<br>Also Dream: Clutches a 1 v 6
MrBeast Gaming,"Can we just thank Dani for making this, and allowing this (yet small) good amount of content"
MrBeast Gaming,Is it just me that feels like Jack and Lazar could be brothers because of how equally funny they are? 😂
MrBeast Gaming,“Honestly I’m voting you out just for making me wake up early”  literally me 😂
MrBeast Gaming,"Dream at round <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbIACyJPaH8&amp;t=1m10s"">1:10</a>IQ Gameplay,<br>Dream at round 2:It&#39;s BIG BRIAN TIME."
MrBeast Gaming,Dream: gets imposter twice in a row. <br>Dream: gets seen killing in front of someone in a row gets voted off <br>Dream: starts making out with mr beast to cover up his act of murder
MrBeast Gaming,&quot;Honestly I&#39;m voting you out for waking me up early&quot;<br>LMFAOO MOOD
MrBeast Gaming,dream: <b>kills</b><br>dani: that’s kinda suspicious bro
MrBeast Gaming,Whenever Dream plays among us (Crewmate or Impooster) he is always sus
MrBeast Gaming,dream gave dani his speedrunning instincts when he trapped him
MrBeast Gaming,Lazar voting Jimmy out because he woke lazar up early is honestly a mood. It’s kind messed up with a 10 hour time difference.
MrBeast Gaming,"Love these among us videos, keep em coming!!! And god bless you Mr Beast for everything you&#39;ve done for people over the years, you are an inspiration to all who seek to better this world, HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!!!!"
MrBeast Gaming,Not gonna lie this whole situation with dream and mr.beast got my fangirl  mind tingling
MrBeast Gaming,"Never thought I would see Mr. Beast, Wildcat and Jack together."
MrBeast Gaming,&quot;did you write that down so that you can read it when youre the impostor&quot; lmao that was fire
MrBeast Gaming,Jack: “I’m almost done with my task!”<br><br>Lazar: “I haven’t done a single task 🙃”
MrBeast Gaming,"i love how Lazar and Wildcat, both creators i&#39;ve watched in the past, Have climbed so far and now play with people like Dream and mr.Beast"
MrBeast Gaming,Chandler being so silent is such a mood lol
MrBeast Gaming,The fact that dream and dani are actually kinda similar in facial structure.
MrBeast Gaming,"dani: “guys u can trust me, I made this game “<br>everyone else: “Understandable have a great day!”"
MrBeast Gaming,&quot;no one was yeeted&quot; quote of history
MrBeast Gaming,MrBeast: “They just voted me out for no reason.”<br>Dream: “First time?”
MrBeast Gaming,Honestly adding jack and Lazar was the best thing that has happened to this channel
MrBeast Gaming,"I NEVER thought I would see a Mr.Beast, Dream, AND Dani collab before quarantine. This is actually insane"
MrBeast Gaming,I like how they just throw someone out for no reason but they get shocked when they aren&#39;t imposter
MrBeast Gaming,"Dream: Slaughters Sapnap infront of dani.<br><br>Dani: Yeah, that&#39;s <b>kinda</b> sus bro"
MrBeast Gaming,“I wanna see what it’s like to be killed in 3D.”-Lazerbeam that got me laughing so hard 😂
MrBeast Gaming,Jack is always included in the unfortunate moments LMAO. he is the messenger of 3d among us.
MrBeast Gaming,Huge props to Lazar for wearing Mav gear
MrBeast Gaming,I love jacksepticeye&#39;s comedic acts
MrBeast Gaming,I&#39;m so happy dani is finally getting the attention he deserves
MrBeast Gaming,&quot;We have everyone playing!&quot; <br><br>Forgets to include the guy who made the game
MrBeast Gaming,"Dani: <b>about to get kicked</b><br>Also Dani: I MADE THIS GAME! TRUST ME!<br>Everyone else: Understandable, have a great day."
MrBeast Gaming,How to tell dream is impostor.<br>-He gets defensive when hes caught as impostor.<br>-usually fumbles with his alibi
MrBeast Gaming,"I don’t normally watch the entire ad, but MrBeast deserves it."
MrBeast Gaming,"Jacks “thank youuu” at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbIACyJPaH8&amp;t=4m04s"">4:04</a> was the best"
MrBeast Gaming,I love it when wildcat is impostor
MrBeast Gaming,Jacksepticeye: this is really wierd seeing people in 3D<br>also him when he looks at a mirror: <b>*confused screaming*</b>
MrBeast Gaming,Jimmy: “Let me find a task. I wanna do one”<br><br>Guarantee you that’s the first time Jimmy has ever said that
MrBeast Gaming,Chandler: dosent get imposter in among us <br>Also Chandler: gets imposter a lot in 3D among us
MrBeast Gaming,I like when Dani said I trust Jack. I like when Jack says thank you.
MrBeast Gaming,Why is it so hard to get killed nowadays?<br>-Lazar 2020
MrBeast Gaming,"Petition for Karl, Chandler, Chris and Jimmy to do a Survival series"
MrBeast Gaming,&quot;Chandlers been impostor a lot today. I&#39;m gonna follow him.&quot;  Biggest brain play to die.
MrBeast Gaming,No one gonna talk about how george said &quot;there no way he gets away with it&quot;<br>At the perfect time... when dream and jimmy were doing their thing
MrBeast Gaming,Karl: Standing Next To &quot;the Drill&quot;<br>Dani: We don&#39;t Speak about &quot;the Drill&quot;
MrBeast Gaming,imagine playing this in VR
MrBeast Gaming,i love how he completely ignores dani lol
MrBeast Gaming,"Dream as Imposter, gets voted out immediatly Dream &quot;I didnt see him&quot;<br>Dream also seeing a sheep from 100000 blocks away in minecraft"
MrBeast Gaming,Let’s take a moment to appreciate that this video is exactly 10 minutes long
MrBeast Gaming,Chris and his humor are the perfect example of that dad who his kid rolls his eyes at but friend thinks is hilarious 😂
MrBeast Gaming,Jimmy and Chris&#39;s friendship is so good that they say this deep and other person notices it without even seeing...
MrBeast Gaming,"Legends say MrBeast never even spoke to the first place contestant, leaving him in complete confusion to this day..."
MrBeast Gaming,"The last person who survived just waiting for jimmy to hand him 10,000 and then being told he didn’t win"
MrBeast Gaming,They should’ve given the person who won first place a compensation prize
MrBeast Gaming,Imagine winning a challenge and then being told the runner up gets the prize.
MrBeast Gaming,"Moral of the story: If you want to win, stay 100km away from Jimmy."
MrBeast Gaming,I love how in every video jimmy makes he always reminds people and his friends that whoever wins gets the prize
MrBeast Gaming,imagine waiting for so long to make it an a mrbeast video and then WIN and learn that you get NOTHING
MrBeast Gaming,I love how Chris and Jimmy just act like idiots together spectating while everyone is just stressing over the challenge.
MrBeast Gaming,Imagine being the last to die but getting nothing
MrBeast Gaming,How to win:<br>Step 1: Don&#39;t attract the attention of Chris or Jimmy
MrBeast Gaming,I feel very bad for the person that actually survived the longest
MrBeast Gaming,"Although impossible without the nether, the ultimate strategy is just to make a bunch of fire resistance potions"
MrBeast Gaming,Imagine the kid in 1st place waiting for jimmy to add him to the call😂
MrBeast Gaming,Can you imagine winning the challenge but not technically winning bc of some random rule they made up without telling anyone? I&#39;d be so pissed
MrBeast Gaming,"Mr Beast: This is a bunch of completely random people playing <br>Karl and Chandler: So that’s what we are to you, just random people<br>Mr Beast: Yes. <br><br><br>LOL"
MrBeast Gaming,Okay but I feel bad for the guy who died last. He was probably so hyped once he saw the other 2 died.
MrBeast Gaming,The pain the last person to die must have experienced is immeasurable
MrBeast Gaming,I loved how Chris just casually had an alpaca half the video lol
MrBeast Gaming,"Karls face at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU99gX7NGZ8&amp;t=7m46s"">7:46</a> was priceless"
MrBeast Gaming,The first place guy still waiting for Jimmy to join his chat to tell him he won.
MrBeast Gaming,legend says the last person is still waiting for his prize
MrBeast Gaming,"Petition for Jimmy ,Karl, Chris and Chandler to make a survival series"
MrBeast Gaming,Can we just appreciate that this video is exactly 10 minutes long?
MrBeast Gaming,Imagine being the person that should have won waiting for Mr. Beast to add him to the call and give him money
MrBeast Gaming,Imagine being a subway employee and seeing $10000 on a gift card😂😂😂
MrBeast Gaming,Jimmy: i bet voice chat is freaking out<br>Chris: probably screaming now<br>Random person: why are my fingers sweating?
MrBeast Gaming,The guy who came in first was probably so happy when he thought he won but when no one called him on discord it all would have changed😢
MrBeast Gaming,"Can we just take a moment to appreciate that this video is exactly <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU99gX7NGZ8&amp;t=10m00s"">10:00</a> long"
MrBeast Gaming,“Chicken and cheese”<br>Bruh Karl’s face in the end 🤣🤣🤣
MrBeast Gaming,"In the thumbnail, Jimmy has the high ground"
MrBeast Gaming,Chris: &quot;WHY DOES EVERYTHING I LOVE DIE&quot;<br>His wife and child: 😱
MrBeast Gaming,"Imagine being the last guy, you get told you didn&#39;t win 💀"
MrBeast Gaming,Is it just me or does Chandler look smarter with glassses on?
MrBeast Gaming,Imagine how disappointed the last person who died is
MrBeast Gaming,Surviving against Chris is the real challenge
MrBeast Gaming,Legend says the Last guy that died is still waiting MrBeast to contact him and tell him that he won
MrBeast Gaming,Legends say that the person who won the challenge is still waiting for his prize.
MrBeast Gaming,I feel so bad for the innocent people who got knocked off by Jimmy and Chris
MrBeast Gaming,"jimmy casually ripping 10,000$ out of a random persons life and laughing while he does it"
MrBeast Gaming,Bro the last guy to who actually should’ve technically won must be really mad
MrBeast Gaming,<b>they don&#39;t know the lava will rise</b> 5 seconds later <b>the best part is that they have no idea that the lava rises</b>
MrBeast Gaming,I cant believe jimmy still doesnt know axes are stronger in java edition
MrBeast Gaming,"I feel so bad for the first place person, they should’ve at least gotten a runner up prizd"
MrBeast Gaming,The last guy who actually thought he won must be coming to this video and crying
MrBeast Gaming,You should make a 100 player natural disaster mode where every 3 minutes a random thing will happen like lava rising or acid rain
MrBeast Gaming,The fact that the video is exactly 10  minutes makes me so happy that I can’t breathe
MrBeast Gaming,"the last person to die: so, when is jimmy going to give me the reward           ( ten years later)                    I&#39;m still waiting for jimmy."
MrBeast Gaming,Thanks again for having me Beast. It was a true challenge starting in the hardest possible biome lol
MrBeast Gaming,Respect to the ocean for defending all the teams because they were put in the middle. Hands down great defence
MrBeast Gaming,The fact that the video title calls it “simulating civilization” but all they’re doing is just building up before fighting each other… That’s an unironically realistic representation of civilization.
MrBeast Gaming,"Fit defended the Ocean like a pro. I think if they focused a lot on archery and sent in a small squad to steal a team they would&#39;ve had it.<br>Edit: Turns out from Fit&#39;s video they couldn&#39;t use arrows, which is just stupid. This was unwinnable for Fit.<br>Edit 2: Turns out they did have a small strike team that was just never shown in this video because it didn&#39;t manage to capture any base. Unlucky honestly."
MrBeast Gaming,"Find it kinda poetic that Fit was being sandwiched for a good long while and his team <b>still</b> went down swinging. Knowing him, to say he has experience in Minecraft wars is an understatement."
MrBeast Gaming,"Good choice with Fit in the middle. It takes a 2b2t to be able to handle the chaos like that, and a damn good 2b player at that. Literally born for the role, great job!"
MrBeast Gaming,"Honestly props to Ocean, they literally defended against everyone at the same time. If Fit had been put in charge anywhere else, it probably would have been one sided lol."
MrBeast Gaming,Yes. You can have literally better cinematography in a minecraft video than in a mainstream film.
MrBeast Gaming,Can you do an actual civilization one one time? I&#39;m obsessed with the $5000 build of the village and kingdom and think it&#39;d be really cool to see you all build your own civilizations more than just the fighting
MrBeast Gaming,I would love to see this again with a bit more prep time and traps allowed.
MrBeast Gaming,"I like how by now, MrBeast has literally convinced his audience to promote his products for him 😂"
MrBeast Gaming,Was an amazing event to be a part of and participate!! Thanks for the opportunity!!
MrBeast Gaming,Still amazes me how about 26 hours worth of footage is condensed down into 8-9 minutes and it still stays just as energetic/engaging
MrBeast Gaming,This is probably the coolest thing I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;d love to watch more of this.
MrBeast Gaming,"This man always tries to do something and extra ordinary and make his audience feel excited for every next,love you"
MrBeast Gaming,"I was waiting for someone to infiltrate a base and they finally did. I&#39;m proud of them, they almost got it lol."
MrBeast Gaming,"Major props to the editor for this video, this would have been super difficult to edit!!!!"
MrBeast Gaming,"As a player in this event, this was definitely a LOT of chaos and fun! Awesome video!"
MrBeast Gaming,"One of the best thing about dude is that he never takes<br>credit for himself when he achieves something. He always<br>respect us, the audience and his team, and he is polite in<br>all his videos. We congratulate ourselves on this"
MrBeast Gaming,They are geniuses all the team of Mr Beast. I admire them very much. Let the SUCCESSES continue guys. Congratulations.
MrBeast Gaming,Literally the most epic Minecraft content I’ve ever seen.
MrBeast Gaming,I would LOVE to see more civilization-based contests
MrBeast Gaming,Once I saw FitMC. I lost it. Dude has super Minecraft knowledge
MrBeast Gaming,"Gotta admit i ran like a coward at the first attemp to attack Jungle, i still hear the scream of my Badland Comrades died behind me that day, that will hunt me in my dream.<br>o7 kachow ya’ll!"
MrBeast Gaming,would’ve loved to see more building action and/or a timelapse
MrBeast Gaming,"the final battle couldve been more interesting if forest took out ice first, then it would be an all out war of forest and jungle, deciding <b>which tree-thriving biome is the champion</b>"
MrBeast Gaming,I respect everyone who were involved in this. Seriously the best piece that I&#39;ve ever seen on YouTube. HATS OFF TO YOU ALL! LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!
MrBeast Gaming,Love your content man. Been watching your stuff for awhile and it&#39;s helped me get through my parents and brother passing away recently. Then had a few surgery&#39;s so I was in the hospital for a few days and just binging YouTube lol. Thanks for the content and the laughs
MrBeast Gaming,"Fit knows how to maximize every aspect of the game, as well as organizing chaotic groups of people. 2b2t has made him a Minecraft god."
MrBeast Gaming,"I love how Jimmy has been doing this for so long that he doesn’t even need to put the amount of money that people win in his video titles, that’s pretty cool"
MrBeast Gaming,Credit to Ocean for holding on that long despite being attacked from all sides.
MrBeast Gaming,"Respect to the ocean team, they had to defend their slime from all the teams all at one time"
MrBeast Gaming,Absolutely entertainment at its finest guys 👦!
MrBeast Gaming,If Fit was on any other team he would’ve dominated the event
MrBeast Gaming,In terms of laser one standing forect won but terms for most battle hardend monecraft players team ocean won the battle. They were the only ones to fend off really well against multiple teams and for that ocean deserves half the money the winner got $15000 to be precise. Fit mc you go man! Also my favorite line from the whole video goes to fit mc &quot;thats right were not giving up that easy&quot;
MrBeast Gaming,Thank you for making these videos! I&#39;ve had a tough past couple of years!
MrBeast Gaming,"Honestly props to Ocean, they literally defended against everyone at the same time.

MrBeast Gaming,i swear mr beast is inspiring me all the time he started from the bottom and grew so big all across his channels Tryna grow my own channel and its been slow but i always watch his vids and the inspiration to keep going is always there<br>thanks for the entertaining content man
MrBeast Gaming,Fit did incredible considering  What he had. If he got any other biome he would&#39;ve won
MrBeast Gaming,I think a great idea would be to invite 1000 people into a Minecraft server and just see what they would do. Simply be observers. Cheers lads.
MrBeast Gaming,"I was wondering why there were no archers, till I realized they were probably on Peaceful. Itd be cool to have a row of archers defending your castle."
MrBeast Gaming,that was truly unexpected . wudo just came out of no where and he got it
MrBeast Gaming,"Ocean was man handling all the invaders, Fit and them could have thrashed the other teams if they landed a good biome"
MrBeast Gaming,"This was enjoyable to watch. I would like to see another one of these, where they have little resources, and can declare war and allies right away. They are just further away from each other. Just be interesting to see who does what. Like you can win with 1 ally, and see if anyone double crosses or does diplomacy well. Trading, etc."
MrBeast Gaming,"Honestly, I want to see him fight like a swarm of Wardens"
MrBeast Gaming,"This was more like &quot;1000 people simulate war&quot;. It was still good, but if you wanna simulate civilization then the end goal has to be different. Instead of &quot;kill everyone and be the last team standing&quot;, it should be something like &quot;be the first to make this many buildings&quot; or &quot;be the first to get to space&quot; or &quot;be the first to collect this many resources&quot;, or perhaps some combination"
MrBeast Gaming,"It would be so cool to have the battle of elements kingdoms, with fire being basically a land of lava, fire etc. and it&#39;s players having fire immunity effect, air being a land of really high, thin trees with thin bringes etc. and it&#39;s players having the slow fall potion effect, water being... Underwater and it&#39;s players breathing fire and earth having lots of soul sand and it&#39;s players having soul speed, also some no man&#39;s lands that are none of the elements."
MrBeast Gaming,I hope the people that did this concept first got credit. This also was more of just a big pvp match. There wasn’t a lot of “civilization” stuff. But fun none the less.
MrBeast Gaming,OK this was absolutely freaking epic! I love this idea!!!
MrBeast Gaming,Honestly I’m surprised people didn’t try make a faction type base those lava water bases were so annoying to break into
Youtuber,Comments
Markiplier,I love that since quarantine we are all watching is old games all over again. I also would love to see him replay this one.
Markiplier,"&quot;Ripley was apparently the only survivor of the Sevastopol incident. She later married, taking the name &quot;McClaren&quot;. Ripley died on December 23, 2178 at the age of 66 from cancer.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m not surprised, all the exposure she faced on (and off) that station to fuck knows what, cancer was definitely plausible. Glad she got the chance to live a full life after all that. :D"
Markiplier,It still amazes me how Mark had barely used the motion sensor and lockers to hide in throughout this 14 hour series
Markiplier,Markiplier: I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE ALIENS ALL AROUND ME!.<br>alien 1: LETS GET HIM. alien 2: no lets wait here for dramatic effect
Markiplier,"If he ever decides to replay a game, this is the one I would like him to do again<br><br>Edit: well that turned out better than expected"
Markiplier,Mark: I wonder if this bolt gun does anything to the alien.<br>Also Mark: Never tries it.
Markiplier,Mark:*complains about not having enough flamethrower fuel*<br>Mark:*obliviously walks past fuel*<br>Me*sigh*
Markiplier,"No one might find this but, something had always felt missing, like I forgot something. I finally realized that I actually haven&#39;t finished Markiplier&#39;s Alien Isolation. Took me six years to finally watch it now. Happy new year everyone."
Markiplier,Low key noisemaker is the MVP of this series
Markiplier,"For the record, I doubt there was a single person still alive on Sevastopol besides Ripley by the time it was destroyed."
Markiplier,"I love how they put in a cameo voice log for Dallas and Mark is like, &quot;whyd they give me that&quot; not knowing it was a cameo."
Markiplier,First Episode: &quot;I really hope there&#39;s more than just one Alien&quot;<br><br><br>Last Episode: &quot;THERE&#39;S MORE THAN ONE?!??!!! I&#39;M BONERONED!!????!!?&quot;
Markiplier,"who else just finished binge watching this entire series, which was super fun by the way."
Markiplier,Mark: &quot;I have nothing to throw!!&quot;<br>Also Mark: <b>Has 6 flares and doesn&#39;t use one the entire game</b>
Markiplier,"The fact that this game alone is widely credited with restoring lost faith in Creative Assembly and the Alien franchise is just astounding, and, honestly, deserved"
Markiplier,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6BTTQbw42g&amp;t=36m44s"">36:44</a> <b>*Elevator almost crushes Mark*</b> &quot;What else could go wrong?&quot;<br><br><br><b>*Less than a minute later.*</b><br><br><br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6BTTQbw42g&amp;t=37m30s"">37:30</a> <b>*Literally just falls over and dies.*</b> &quot;Nooo! NOOOOO!!!&quot;"
Markiplier,"I view this playthrough as a standalone Alien movie. I watch it every few months. So enjoyable.<br><br> This game is definetly a love letter to the original Alien movie, very well done."
Markiplier,2014 Markiplier - Afraid of trollies <br>2022 Markiplier - &quot;I could take it&quot;
Markiplier,&quot;There are literally hundreds of them&quot; - Markiplier<br>&quot;THERES MORE THAN ONE!?!?!?&quot; - Also Markiplier
Markiplier,After 7 whole years I still came back to binge watch it again in 2022
Markiplier,"&quot;You didn&#39;t tell me it was here!&quot;<br><br>Mark. It&#39;s everywhere. Everywhere. After 14 hours in game, you should know this by now buddy.<br><br>&quot;More than one? They have more than one? THERE&#39;S MORE THAN ONE?&quot;<br><br>Yes Mark. You knew that already."
Markiplier,Mark: Im not gonna spray my flame thrower willy nilly<br><br><br><br><br><b>starts spraying flamethrower willy nilly to kill a facehugger</b>
Markiplier,"“Well, huggles all around.”<br>I found this channel last night and I’ve been rotf ever since."
Markiplier,Come back every year or so to binge the entire series. Never gets old.<br>Anyone else?
Markiplier,Ripley- &quot;JESUS!&quot; <br>Mark- &quot;No I-I believe that was a train.&quot;<br>That part made my face hurt from smiling
Markiplier,I still can&#39;t believe they got Sigourney Weaver for this game! What a great series!
Markiplier,"omg the part where he flips out cause of the face hugger in the tunnel and blows fire everywhere made me laugh so hard i started choking on my gum, i literally almost died HAHAHAH"
Markiplier,I think my favourite part of the whole play through was Mark yelling &quot;SSPPPAAACCCEEE!&quot; every time he saw space
Markiplier,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6BTTQbw42g&amp;t=37m31s"">37:31</a><br>Ripley: &quot;What do you need me to do...&quot;<br><b>dies</b><br>Hahaha perfect timing."
Markiplier,"Who else just finished binge watching this entire series, which was super fun by the way."
Markiplier,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6BTTQbw42g&amp;t=29m44s"">29:44</a> <br><br>Rip: &quot;Jesus!&quot;<br>Mark: &quot;No, I believe that was a train&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m dying"
Markiplier,I got every achievement on this game. 10/10 experience through and through.
Markiplier,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6BTTQbw42g&amp;t=1m05s"">1:05</a> this part is made of pure terror. In darkness... in the end of all your supplies... with the alien&#39;s screams echoing all over the place (not mention he starts to slowly stalk you in the hallway without making a single fucking noise).<br>This game is pure gold."
Markiplier,Rewatching this series now and it hits right in the feels. This was such a great series.
Markiplier,"I love that the way he is programmed makes him learn, if you hide in a locker over and over again he will know"
Markiplier,"The most imersive and scariest Alien videogame in gaming history, that&#39;s for sure."
Markiplier,"Mark, the encounters with the Alien did get harder, but that is mainly because the Alien is a Dynamic AI, not a linear one like all other games, meaning it adapts and learns from the player, for example, you were using fire a lot, and later you noticed the Alien was a little scared when you had the flamethrower out, remember? You played almost the same way through the entire game, that is why it got a lot harder for you, since the Alien started to learn how you played.<br>This AI really impressed me and I can&#39;t wait what advance AI we will have in the future.<br>You are fascinated with space, I&#39;m fascinated with AI&#39;s :)"
Markiplier,I love how the alien is just like &quot;I smell a markimoo that has done goofed&quot; lol
Markiplier,"Almost 4 years later, and this is still one of my favorite series to watch. Both for the Aliens franchise, and watching Mark play it. =)"
Markiplier,I now really want a VR version of this game would be so terrifying
Markiplier,Currently laughing my ass off at the long hallway crawl. The screaming. Is so intense. And the crawling. Is SO. SLOW. OHMYGOD. I CANT.
Markiplier,still one of the best AI&#39;s ever even in 2021 imo and one of my favorite playthroughs.
Markiplier,"My only criticism is that sometimes the game sometimes felt like it was making poor excuses to extend itself. Like being captured before putting your suit on, just to wake up and have even farther to go."
Markiplier,mark: tries to throw a noisemaker<br>ripley jr.: hm no this is better (sets it on the table)
Markiplier,"I can&#39;t believe that he remembers some really specific Alien things, but he doesn&#39;t remember the climax of the movie."
Markiplier,"I watched this series when it first came out, and have watched it probably once a year ever since. This and The Evil Within I find myself always coming back to for some reason."
Markiplier,"I played this game for the first time start to finish after having seen Mark&#39;s playthrough right around when it came out, and I loved it. This gives me so much nostalgia."
Markiplier,"Ahh, thank you for playing thru this game for us to see :D<br>I own the game and was only able to put about two hours into it but never finished it cause of life things. <br>I been a huge fan for years, loved this let&#39;s play :)"
Markiplier,&quot;The androids were creepy at first but then they just became annoying and tedious.&quot; <br>I can&#39;t express how much I agree with that statement.
Markiplier,"Markimoo during the last three vids of this series: Where do I go?<br>ME: check your map.<br>MARK: Where do I GOOOO?!<br>ME: CHECK YOUR GODDAMN MAP.<br>MARK: [goes the wrong way]<br><br>Unrelated, great game. I&#39;m a huge fan of you Mark, and this is hands down the best game ever from the Alien series."
Markiplier,"Here&#39;s a few tips for anyone having trouble with the Frost Troll at earlier levels- 

1- Bring Lydia, or another follower. They do great damage while soaking it up. <br>2- Save your Frostbite Venom for this fight- It wreaks havoc on his health and stamina. <br>3- You should have 1-2 Scrolls of Fireball if you&#39;ve been following the main quest- This is why. The Frost Troll is weak to fire. Use them. <br>4- If you found the Scroll of Summon Storm Atronach like Mark did, use it- It has the potential to nearly kill the Frost Troll on it&#39;s own. <br>5- Bows are your friend. Idc what playstyle you&#39;re going for, you should always carry a bow for enemies like this, that simply shred you in melee. Also for dragons, as they tend to, you know... FLY. <br><br>There ya go, protips for the Mark-fans. Feel free to comment/message with ANY Skyrim related questions... I&#39;m confidant I have the answer. ;3 "
Markiplier,"&quot;There are probably some impassible parts for a horse...&quot; That&#39;s funny, considering horses are the best goddamn mountain climbers in the game."
Markiplier,"This is my favorite game ever! I love it because of where it takes place in, the history, the graphics are amazing, it&#39;s just beautiful, I absolutely LOVE the music, it reminds me of good times in the past, and I love the quests. I just love this game so much, it just makes me so happy."
Markiplier,I wonder if anyone made artwork of Mark&#39;s argonian prancing through a field picking flowers lol.
Markiplier,At least you took Lydia down to hell with you before you got... trolled. Thats very romantic.
Markiplier,"Most beautiful horse ingame in my opinion. I love that breed of horse. Also, Mark. You should save up 1k and buy your own! Heehee. Owned horses won&#39;t run away. Everytime I make a new char I save up 1k and buy a horse 1st thing before I even continue the main story."
Markiplier,"Wow! I wasn&#39;t sure id like this game, but it&#39;s very cool! Great video mark! Good job!"
Markiplier,"If that horse turns on a dime, then it must be Mr. Krabs&#39; FIRST dime."
Markiplier,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mev7vETPFh4&amp;t=5m01s"">5:01</a> to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mev7vETPFh4&amp;t=5m04s"">5:04</a> nice entrance lidia best lag entrance ever"
Markiplier,Mark needs to revisit Skyrim when the remaster comes out
Markiplier,"Impassible places for horses? Ha! Horse physics are different in Skyrim, Mark!"
Markiplier,Laziest. Dragonborn. Ever.
Markiplier,Rain on a frozen mountain? What madness is Sheogorath playing at!?
Markiplier,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mev7vETPFh4&amp;t=6m58s"">6:58</a> Waits for mark to ride off the cliff on accident intensely"
Markiplier,"He just sliced his axe through Lydia&#39;s neck, his horse just ran away and he died by a troll....... Tough life"
Markiplier,"I played this game and when I got Lydia, we started up the 7,000 steps and her AI broke and she stood frozen as I ran up, not realizing her face had been bitten off by an Ice Wolf. She died forever. D&#39;:"
Markiplier,"lawl! When Lidia goes to follow Markiplier while he&#39;s riding his horse, it&#39;s like she&#39;s going, &quot;When all else fails, fuck it! Apparate!&quot;"
Markiplier,"the secret to killing trolls is fire, otherwise they regenerate health"
Markiplier,"He had a bow and arrows, yet did not think of using them on the troll. Pick it off from a safe distance, you know? Oh well - live and learn (or die and learn, in video games)!"
Markiplier,Don&#39;t you hate it when your horse tries to kill an op enemy and then gets slaughtered
Markiplier,I&#39;m glad he eventually learned how volume levels work. You have to put the volume so low on some of these YouTube game reviewers that you can&#39;t hear the game anymore.
Markiplier,"Markiplier, Destroyer of Dragons, Prey of Frost Trolls."
Markiplier,"I&#39;m watching mark play skyrim, while I&#39;m playing skyrim. XD"
Markiplier,9:21 He misses the troll and kills lydia XD
Markiplier,Does anyone else like when Mark and Lydia murder the Hunter for the horse?
Markiplier,I love watching these playthroughs because they say my name a lot XD 
Markiplier,"Took me like 300 arrows to put that troll down... 
Running away from it never accured to me..."
Markiplier,"I got attacked by a dragon that had no space to land, so I had to attack him with iron arrows and the weakest bow (can&#39;t remember the name) since I fought him for like 15 minutes and the dragon was still with 90% of health I started looking for a better place to fight and for the dragon to land and when I walked a little the troll appeared... I was level 8 or something like that, it wasn&#39;t good. "
Markiplier,I actually got attacked by a dragon right before getting attacked by the troll
Markiplier,The Seven Thousand Steps are nearly impossible to climb in survival mode. The only reason I made it to the top was my werewolf form.
Markiplier,I usually lead the frost troll to the Greybeards and let them kill it.
Markiplier,That horse is amazing!
Markiplier,"She accidentally got into a fight with one of my other followers while I have Ultimate Follower Overhaul(it does alot of things,and allows multiple followers). She didn&#39;t die, but I had to throw a paralysis grenade(another mod) to get them to cut it out."
Markiplier,You&#39;re lucky you got a horse that knows when to run away!  My horse tried to fight a dragon!  You can&#39;t survive that horsey!
Markiplier,&quot;Victory is yours I -- Ahhh&quot;<br>my sides
Markiplier,if you don&#39;t actually buy the horse with your own money it&#39;ll walk away when you aren&#39;t riding it haha
Markiplier,"Take a look at my horse, my horse is amazing, give it a lick, mmm, it tastes just like raisins. Good reference Mark!"
Markiplier,He&#39;s like that student that every teacher hates lol
Markiplier,even when you start the game the song is even sung in Dovahzul ( Dragon tongue)
Markiplier,and now Markiplier has a bounty in what every hold he&#39;s near.
Markiplier,I know this lets play is old but i still rage that he missed that side quest to take the supplys up the mountain.
Markiplier,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mev7vETPFh4&amp;t=1m16s"">1:16</a> ~ well this environment turned Kholat pretty quick!"
Markiplier,I went the same way as mark and found out i went the long way to the grey beards
Markiplier,When I was going up to the graybeards I ran past the troll all the way up the mountain with my heart thumping and when I opened the door Lydia teleported to me so it was a win win situation.
Markiplier,the 1 downside of acualy playing a warrior (or close combat character) you run out of potions very quickly xD my first time playing i was dual wield (later on switched to dual wielding only if i felt like it and switched it with a shield) and most of the time i got in with allot of potions (a dungeon) and got out with very little left or i had to use the potions i found in the dungeon for the last bit of it
Markiplier,"If you get Uthgred the Unbroken, then kill her, BAM instant steel plate armour"
Markiplier,Lol! 9:21 he missed the Troll and killed Lydia before he died xD
Markiplier,Be nice to her Mark. Lydia is nowhere near as beefy as you. :D
Markiplier,"its like lord of the rings, we watched him get there half the time ahahahha "
Markiplier,I wish when you finished the game you got the option to re-watch all the recordings you made through the cams.
Markiplier,"I kinda like the dude at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY1NtCffOGk&amp;t=7m25s"">7:25</a> who went:<br>&quot;You, ah, didn&#39;t wait until I finished. But I saved some for you. Just wait. Wait...&quot; before running down the stairs, appearantly in a hurry to fetch you something. Probably pieces of a dead person for you to eat. Still it&#39;s a nice gesture that he wanted to share with you. XD"
Markiplier,I like how Mark is like the only person who blurred the genitalia. Jacksepticeye and pewds both like zoomed in on and obsessed over them. 
Markiplier,&quot;okay so that guy is kinda going nuts over there&quot;<br><br>mark its an asylum
Markiplier,Aww. The twins are so polite. 
Markiplier,Anyone else love the sound of the naked guys&#39; voices? They did some amazing work on the voice acting.
Markiplier,Difference between Mark and Cry.<br><br>Mark: Blurs the parts where you can see a patients genitals.<br>Cry: ZOOMS THE FUCK IN.
Markiplier,"&quot;Ohhh, you&#39;re so beautiful! What do you do to keep that incredible complexion? Nothing?! I can&#39;t believe it!&quot; Ahh Mark, your sense of humor in horror games never gets old. 😂😂😂"
Markiplier,"I&#39;ve seen most top youtubers playythroughs of outlast and markiplier&#39;s reaction to the crazy naked freak duo is the best by far haha, &quot;they&#39;re SO naked!!&quot;"
Markiplier,"Jumpscare Times<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY1NtCffOGk&amp;t=0m20s"">0:20</a> (The Apostle)<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY1NtCffOGk&amp;t=2m45s"">2:45</a> (Arm)<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY1NtCffOGk&amp;t=4m55s"">4:55</a> (Face)<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY1NtCffOGk&amp;t=5m55s"">5:55</a> (Straitjacket)<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY1NtCffOGk&amp;t=10m50s"">10:50</a> (Anonymous)"
Markiplier,"Miles had to have been knocked out for somewhere close to 12 hours...<br>Basically in that time, Martin has gone around the Asylum, setting up an elaborate path for Miles to follow.<br><br>In Whistleblower, while we&#39;re playing as Waylon Park, we run into Martin as he&#39;s preparing the &quot;Down the Drain&quot; message on the wall. And the way he refers to us as &quot;another poor soul&quot; is meant to imply that Martin has clearly met Miles at this point. But then after, Waylon runs into Gluskin who knocks him out for 12 hours.<br>Waylon wakes up around the time of Martin&#39;s death and Miles discovering the underground lab - as seen when he escapes from Gluskin and sees the church burning.<br><br>This has to mean that in order for Miles to and Park to both have been there, Miles had to have been knocked out for a time nearly on par with Waylon&#39;s 12 hours, in order for the ends of their stories to cross like they do.<br>Miles is in the building - knocked out - at the point where Waylon runs into Martin. Miles is still knocked out as Waylon plays through most of his adventure, until he&#39;s knocked out by Gluskin. Then, sometime while Waylon is knocked out, Miles wakes up and finishes his run through."
Markiplier,"Mark: <b>watches big dude rip a guy&#39;s head off</b> &quot;Aw man, I didn&#39;t get that on camera...&quot;<br>Me: Mark my homeslice breadslice pal ur cam was already up"
Markiplier,character&#39;s goal: escape insane asylum<br><br><b>climbs out window</b><br><br><b>climbs back in</b>
Markiplier,I love this Mark. Don&#39;t get me wrong. I love the current Mark too. Its just that he is different back then. He is adorable and stoopy doopy.
Markiplier,"I love how he just kinda disreguarded the whole, close doors behind you to slow down pursuors thing"
Markiplier,I&#39;m always asking &quot;Why doesn&#39;t he close the doors behind him?&quot;
Markiplier,"You know i will give special credit to whoever voiced the two big naked guys, they are genuenly scary but in a different way.<br><br>Is not that they look like monsters but how strangly calm they sound when discussing about the ways they are going to kill. They just sound so natural its actualy scarier than any monster so far.<br><br>Sometimes the worst monster is simply a the humn being i guess."
Markiplier,"I literally keep saying to the screen &quot;open the door faster&quot;, &quot;RUN MARKIE RUUUUUN!&quot;, &quot;MARKIPLIER NO! YOU DONT GO THAT WAY AUGH MARK THAT&#39;S THE WRONG WAY!!!!&quot; and so on and so forth.<br>But so far, this is really enjoyable!"
Markiplier,"Interesting side note: I read the wiki and apparently the two naked guys actually do come after you, they&#39;re not like other enemies though, they&#39;re completely silent and if they catch you it&#39;s instant death. They were chasing mark at some point, he just never noticed."
Markiplier,"&quot;Weell, glad you guys are being polite about this, you&#39;re very civil-- WOW! ohmy, o-oh my God! I-<b>chuckles</b> I didn&#39;t mean to look down!&quot;"
Markiplier,"Sometimes Marks reactions are scarier then the actual game. Like some jumpscares wouldn&#39;t normally make me jump, bit then Mark screams and it makes me jump... Ugh, that&#39;s why I love you Markimoo."
Markiplier,&quot;There is so much for you to witness...&quot;<br>&quot;Like your ugly face?&quot;<br>I&#39;M DYING.  XD
Markiplier,I love how great job they did on this game.<br>- Great voice actors<br>- Its really a scary game<br>- good animations<br>- good idea<br>- kind of realistic but not because there is no monsters in real life.
Markiplier,&quot;There&#39;s never anything under the stairs!&quot;<br>Except in Harry Potter
Markiplier,&quot;Maybe you can witness a toothbrush in your mouth&quot;<br><br><br>-Markiplier 2013
Markiplier,Mark seems really happy playing this game :)
Markiplier,"I love that in a place like this there are still some polite people, like the twins that politely discussed which body parts they will eat and that guy behind the door that runs to fetch you some food, what positive minds!"
Markiplier,"&quot;I would like to kill him.&quot;<br>&quot;Oh, no thank you.&quot;"
Markiplier,One of the reasons why I watch markiplier: His voice is awesome xD
Markiplier,"I just realized that the document he reads at about <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY1NtCffOGk&amp;t=9m10s"">9:10</a> could be talking about the priest. The priest could have been that patient whose delusions of a &quot;higher calling&quot; were getting worse so that may be why his priest garb looks like it has been created from a straight jacket or patient clothing of some sort."
Markiplier,That moment when Markiplier just narrowly misses witnessing the necrophilia scene... o_O
Markiplier,"I like to think that after the patrolling guy banged down the door, the &quot;I&#39;d like you to stay quiet&quot; guy killed him and dragged the body away. It would make a certain amount of sense, since, y&#39;know, when you first see him, he just killed a guy who apparently hadn&#39;t been quiet enough."
Markiplier,"Mark: &quot;Well! Glad you&#39;re all being so polite about this, you&#39;re very civil&quot; he looks down &quot;oh my god...!&quot;"
Markiplier,Mark: “Yeah I bet he’s a patrol guy”<br>Proceeds to walk into the room with him.
Markiplier,"Outlast is an appropriate title indeed.<br>Mark has to outlast the horrors, madness, darkness, murder and sexual assaults of this insane Asylum while searching for a ghost that kills S.W.A.T. soldiers X_X<br>I do not want to trade my place with that Main Character X_X"
Markiplier,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY1NtCffOGk&amp;t=3m49s"">3:49</a><br>I can&#39;t help but think of &quot;Ya&#39; know, I heard they&#39;d be naked, but that&#39;s a lot more naked than I thought!&quot;"
Markiplier,"I love it how the Twins talk to each other, such polite and homicidal manners."
Markiplier,I loved the beginning! <br><br>Markiplier was just such a sarcastic jerk to the guy I loved it xD<br><br>&quot;There is so much yet for you to witness.&quot;<br>&quot;Like your ugly face? It&#39;s pretty nice?&quot;<br><br>XDDDD laughed so hard
Markiplier,&quot;I&#39;d like you to stay quiet.&quot;<br><br>Mark: &quot;I- I will be so quiet. I&#39;ll be so quiet for you.&quot; O_O
Markiplier,"Mark : You&#39;re so beautiful, how do keep that complexion?<br>The man : Am I a joke to you?"
Markiplier,&quot;There is so much left for you to witness.&quot; &quot;Like your ugly face?&quot; I laughed so hard my Warfstache turned purple.
Markiplier,"I think a weird thing is: He has to open the main gate, but that&#39;s not where he came in! He ducked through a hole in the side of the gate!"
Markiplier,The naked guys remind me of a twisted tweedle dee and tweedle dum.
Markiplier,It should be possible to end games like this by taking the sensible route and hoofing it whenever an opportunity presents itself. Okay if sometimes a supernatural element makes that impossible or very difficult but it should always be an option so we have to choose between forcing ourselves to find an answer or giving in to the fear and running away.
Markiplier,"I&#39;ve never played, but wouldn&#39;t it have been more logical to just hop out the window he was hanging off of if he wanted to escape? I know it was a drop but still."
Markiplier,I remember when I was playing I was walking down the hall and saw one of the naked guys and I literally just swung around and flung myself out that window in a second. Those two big guys were awesome! I&#39;m so glad they were in the DLC too.
Markiplier,"Mark: &quot;WOAH, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR FACE?!&quot;<br>Me: &quot;Oh my God Mark, you can&#39;t just ask people what&#39;s wrong with their face. tsk&quot; ;)<br>Sorry... I saw an opportunity... and I took it :D"
Markiplier,“Maybe you should witness a toothbrush in your mouth” it’s absolutely golden
Markiplier,I really wanted to see Marks&#39; reaction to the necrophilia part.
Markiplier,"Hey, I found out that at one point the developers considered having Miles get sexually assaulted at some point in the game. Maybe the twins are necrophiliacs as well as cannibals? Or, if they were the ones that were going to sexually assault him, would they just be rapists and cannibals? Or would it be that creepy necrophiliac that calls Miles a sicko? Or is it another Variant all together? Or would it be Father Martin? You know where I&#39;m going with that. =__=<br><br>Either way, I just had this thought when the twin&#39;s mentioned desires because my mind is perpetually in the gutter."
Markiplier,That awesome moment when you realize Mark is livestreaming and u go on to watch it and it ends 15 seconds later...... if only i had realized sooner... well time to wait for the nxt one!!! :D
Markiplier,Congrats on surpassing your goal for charity Mark! You are a really awesome person! :)
Markiplier,"That was #totesmcscrotes the best livestream I&#39;ve ever been part of, thank you Mark for being such a good person and so funny! Congrats on your success!"
Markiplier,Thank you and Wade so much for singing Happy Birthday to me and my twin. Best Birthday gift ever.
Markiplier,"Wow 30,1 Million and youre still growing. Its facinating how small someone can Start and with the time you just get bigger and bigger. But i was youre fan till the first video you&#39;ve ever Made.  And i thank you for being there 9 years now. Everytime i see how sucessful you are makes me emotional. &lt;3"
Markiplier,the live stream was fantastic!! :D best way to spend a day
Markiplier,"Oh I remember that moment, I saw your comment in the chatbox and they were suddenly both singing Happy Birthday to you and your twin ;D Hope you had a good day"
Markiplier,that thrusting part made laugh so hard xD.
Markiplier,"Alas, the time zones were too different :(
But great success with charity!"
Markiplier,We did! That just made it cloud nine level of awesomeness. ^-^
Markiplier,"My mum suffered from Cancer, she&#39;s been in the clear for about 19 years now. On behalf of my mum, i&#39;d like to thankyou for raising awareness of breast cancer. &lt;3"
Markiplier,"00:00 Oh god, your face nearly gave me a heart attack!"
Markiplier,Oh the memories

Markiplier,"Dang, looks like this is the least viewed Markiplier video"

Markiplier,Did Bob come back at some point? I had to leave after 6 hours.
Markiplier,"Wow, comparing you here to you now, you sure look older. But i guess it makes sense that you do..."
Markiplier,Im sad :( my phone crashed and i missed the last 3 hours i about threw my phone... Really glad i didnt
Markiplier,(G)old days ;)
Markiplier,Why doesn&#39;t this have more likes?
Markiplier,Bravo Bravo..Encore
Markiplier,"i would see you!

Markiplier,"there&#39;s 2 fucking 24 hours livestreams now fml, i don&#39;t know what to watch, creatures or this D:"
Markiplier,is he doing anything besides minecraft?
Markiplier,"do u know mark that boyz don&#39;t have

Markiplier,Interior crocodile alligator
Markiplier,"Not as much good as Mark! ;)
He got long hair and a beard... i thought in the first time that he&#39;s his uncle or someone else... "
Markiplier,Can i get the ip for it i wanna play wit u guys
Markiplier,Why Why Why is there no video on the livestream?
Markiplier,Markiplier #601... so... many... videos
Markiplier,"F*cking Wi-fi ! I can&#39;t watch it :,(
Kill me now please"
Markiplier,niceeeee
Markiplier,hi mark
Markiplier,"Message for Mark! The rings are used to find the abandoned houses which lead to puzzles deep in the void. When you see like a bunch of fireflies in the void, throw the rings around the rocks near them. It should lead you to the puzzles where it should give you the mystery boxes to put on the sacrifice tables at the next station."
Markiplier,"Mark has an impressive ability to ignore on-screen tutorials. Actually no, not ignore. That might imply he noticed it but refused to read it. He doesn&#39;t seem to notice at all that 1/5th of his screen is taken up by instructions for the things he is doing."
Markiplier,Raft was easily one of my favorite series with the three of you and this has similar vibes so I&#39;m a very happy potato indeed to see this continued!
Markiplier,Wade: “I just want the goopy woopies”<br><br>Mark: “why do you want the goopies”<br><br>Wade: “because they feel good in my pockets”
Markiplier,Everyone: “Enemies!”<br><br>Wade: Takes a sip from trusty vault thirteen canteen.
Markiplier,"Bob: <b>panicked</b> also, he’s invincible, he’s invincible.<br><br>Wade: Because that’s me.<br><br>Bob: Oh. <br><br><b>Much more panicked</b> WADES INVINCIBLE?"
Markiplier,"Mark - Skips over the lore at the beginning of the game and talks about how he likes to be just thrown into a game.<br><br>Also Mark - Idk, I think there&#39;s some lore here to discover guys.<br><br>😂😂😂"
Markiplier,I love how the guys always keep talking about &quot;there must be some lore here somewhere&quot; because mark wasn&#39;t paying attention in the slightest when he was starting the game in his first episode
Markiplier,Mark: &quot;WHY DID YOU GATHER SO MUCH GREEN GOO!?&quot;<br><br>Wade: <b>whispers</b> &quot;Content&quot;
Markiplier,I wonder when mark is going to realise that he&#39;s starving to death...
Markiplier,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d04HPPK-ZeQ&amp;t=17m28s"">17:28</a> Imagine if debate really was like that. Just: <br>Rulekeeper: &quot;You broke a rule.&quot;<br>Debater: &quot;What? What rule did I break?&quot;<br>Rulekeeper: &quot;I can&#39;t tell you. Remember rule number 1? Only I&#39;m allowed to know the rules. But you <i>DID</i> just break one.. And that&#39;s all I&#39;m allowed to say.&quot;"
Markiplier,"There are two constants in every good Mark, Bob, and Wade series:<br>1) &quot;previously on&quot;<br>and <br>2) bob calling someone a wizard"
Markiplier,I love how the climax of the intro for this was Mark saying: &quot;Because I can see it.&quot;
Markiplier,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d04HPPK-ZeQ&amp;t=2m50s"">2:50</a> Someone please animate Bob accidentally shooting Wade, then panicking when Mark says he&#39;s invincible XD"
Markiplier,"That card game is called “mao” and it’s very fun. Three things can/should be said to newcomers:<br>1. It plays like Uno <br>2. The winner of each round gets to pick one other person and make a new rule with them<br>3. We’re not allowed to talk about the rules of the game<br>The base rules vary from person to person and region to region, which makes it even better. It’s not a game that can be played by all entirely new people, there should always be an experienced player. Even then though, you can just make new house rules if no one knows the rules. That’s the magic of the game :)"
Markiplier,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d04HPPK-ZeQ&amp;t=19m52s"">19:52</a> I can’t stop laughing so hard the Way Mark keeps saying “Enemies” The way he says it, and the Zoom edit with the pointed finger makes it more funnier, Most favorite moment ever."
Markiplier,“Boys we’re gonna have a garden.” I LOVE when the warp happens on Mark’s face. Makes me laugh every time. Thank you💙
Markiplier,This series makes me realize how much I&#39;ve missed the raft and Forest series...
Markiplier,I&#39;m really enjoying this game and want to see this crew get to an &quot;engine level&quot; train.
Markiplier,"I love how Mark gets rings, and doesn’t read the instructions that cover the entire right side of the screen."
Markiplier,"That visual gag when Mark just continued to say, &quot;enemies&quot; made me laugh really hard."
Markiplier,"I started going through and re-watching videos from years ago of Mark, Wade, and Bob playing together. I&#39;ve been going through a very hard time of depression lately and these videos help me get through it more than I could explain and actually make me genuinely laugh for once. I look forward to a new video everyday. 💛 Thank you guys."
Markiplier,Mark- &quot;I believe there is some Lore.&quot;<br><b>MatPat joins the chat</b>
Markiplier,Mark second round of the card game: &quot;You know the rules and SO DO I!&quot;
Markiplier,Mark: *aggressively ignoring the on-screen prompts for how to do things *<br>Mark 30 seconds later: &quot;Sorry guys I don&#39;t know how to do things!&quot;
Markiplier,"First rule of the game of Mao, Mark: you can’t talk about the rules"
Markiplier,I see a constant trend of Wade having all the technical problems in these multiplayer games whilst Mark and Bob are laughing their butts off xD
Markiplier,&quot;Why do you want the goopies so bad?&quot;<br>&quot;Cause they feel good in my pocket.&quot;
Markiplier,Bob Wade and Mark are a staple of my YouTube experience at this point
Markiplier,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d04HPPK-ZeQ&amp;t=17m55s"">17:55</a> KING MAO! My cousins taught me that game over the summer. I had the same experience. They told me to not get discouraged cause most new players end up with half the deck in their hand the first few times. I did okay the first round and I won the second and got to add a new rule. I based mine off of one of my cousins rules and when I enforced it they loved it so much. Best time I’ve had while staying away from home."
Markiplier,Bob: Also he&#39;s not taking damage?! HE&#39;S <b>insert Invincible title card here</b>
Markiplier,"Slot machine: <b>displays 3 pufferfish looking monsters</b><br>Mark: Oooh, oooh, OOOH!!<br>Slot machine: <b>spits out a piece of log</b><br>Mark: I got a… log…<br>Me: :👏👏👏👏👏👏👏"
Markiplier,"Hey Mark, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll ever see this but I just wanted to say thank you so much for what you do. Sometimes throughout the year, I&#39;ll get really down in the dumps but your videos always lift me up and put a smile on my face. I can&#39;t tell you how much I appreciate that. Thank you so very much, I hope you&#39;re doing well."
Markiplier,"Mark, Wade, and Bob: <b>gambling</b><br><br>The thing in front of their train: I&#39;m <b>WAITING.</b>"
Markiplier,"I love this trio, I will watch this on repeat 10 times can&#39;t get enough of them"
Markiplier,"I seriously watched the part at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d04HPPK-ZeQ&amp;t=2m55s"">2:55</a> at least five times because it was just too funny hahaha<br><br>Bob: He&#39;s not taking damage. He&#39;s invincible!<br>Wade: It&#39;s me! You&#39;re shooting me!<br>Bob: WaDe&#39;S iNvInCiBlE???"
Markiplier,"Hoping this series goes as long as the Forest one did, I love seeing the three of them together!"
Markiplier,Their chemistry is just so on point 🔆👍🏼
Markiplier,Every time mark says “I think there’s some lore here” he’s just giving MatPat more content. I’m so glad I watch both of them
Markiplier,"Hands down one of my new favorite series, I can already feel the nostalgia kicking in for when it is inevitably forgotten halfway through and never revisited."
Markiplier,"For anyone wondering, the card game Mark was referring to is called Mao."
Markiplier,Bob shooting Wade thinking he’s an enemy.<br><br>Bob later finding out he was shooting Wade:  Wade’s invincible? <br><br>That had me cracking up 🤣😂
Markiplier,If this game doesn&#39;t have giant flying manta rays I&#39;m going to be sad. They would fit perfectly in this environment
Markiplier,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d04HPPK-ZeQ&amp;t=5m59s"">5:59</a> I just love the way Mark screams like that 😆"
Markiplier,I love how Mark keeps forgetting about his hunger and thirst 😂
Markiplier,I love Lixian&#39;s editing and when there was this cinematic and dramatic intro into them just going beep beep beep beep just made me laugh and admire his editing.
Markiplier,"God I love this series! There&#39;s just something so pleasing about the aesthetic and how steampunk it is being old and new at the same time and the explorative nature of it and all the crafting and I feel like I&#39;m not making any sense because this stuff has been done before, but like-- not in this way. I don&#39;t know exactly what it is, but I just love it! Ok? Ok."
Markiplier,&quot;there&#39;s lore here!&quot;<br><br>MatPat: <b>*skuttles over*</b> &quot;what did you just say?
Markiplier,I&#39;m waiting for the moment that they &quot;accidentally&quot; destroy the train.<br><br>Hopefully it will be hilarious 😆
Markiplier,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d04HPPK-ZeQ&amp;t=8m08s"">8:08</a> reminds me of “We have so much more room for activities”<br>That one’s for the distractible fans"
Markiplier,"Anyone else out there who was telling mark to pull the white lever? There was clearly a door with a white line on it.<br>Ah well, great video mark!"
Markiplier,"I just love how in almost all of your Let&#39;s Plays you hunt for easter eggs... and the one time you don&#39;t, you miss one. XD The locked door in the corner of the Experimental Foundry had one in it."
Markiplier,"What a great way to start the day.
Woke up yet having a sleepy head, watched this one, and because Mark screams so hard and girly, instantly awake. "
Markiplier,I love it wen mark is like &quot;uh oh I done bad!&quot; I just find it hilarious
Markiplier,"Wow, now this is an amazing custom story. D:"
Markiplier,This custom story is friggin sweet. Probably your best by far.
Markiplier,"You was awesome in the lever puzzle room when you got the key in your first try without releasing any prisoner. :D Those shadow things are scary indeed, especially the sound they make.
If you want to see a new scary sh*t monster, I suggest you try the Amnesia custom story &quot;Library of Alexandria&quot;. It&#39;s short but nicely done."
Markiplier,I totally agree with Mark about this custom story - it&#39;s so intricate and well thought out! I love when people put effort into creating a whole new universe…I love this! :D
Markiplier,"I usually hate live commentaries, but your amazing voice skills make these completely worth it."
Markiplier,Good god mark. I know this is an old video but FOLLOW THE LIGHTS!
Markiplier,Coolest monster ever! I can&#39;t believe how cool the environments are!
Markiplier,"I WANT MORE!!! 
This is the most interesting amnesia costume story I have ever seen O_O 
"
Markiplier,13:16 - You thought the darkness was your ally.
Markiplier,"I just wanna say, whenever I play amnesia and I see a monster, I will shit my pants right in the spot for self defense! I love how brave Mark is when one pops out. xD"
Markiplier,Great episode Mark !
Markiplier,This is like something out of a Doctor Who episode!! So far I think this is the coolest custom story you&#39;ve played yet!
Markiplier,The Darkness FINALLY shows itself!? That is so cool!
Markiplier,That would be unexpecting to see the grunt come up and not attack him or also go after any other monsters if he runs into any. Since he gave it the resin.
Markiplier,i CANNOT wait for the next installment!!! 
Markiplier,Very cool. Looking forward to more.
Markiplier,"Something that is so easily remedied with.... &quot;Alright... move along.&quot; First it was Jumanji, now Brian Regan references? How much more awesome can you get?"
Markiplier,"7500 views on this, 574000 on a slender video of yours. All of your videos deserve numbers like that, and higher! Keep it up, Mark!"
Markiplier,"I kept thinking that he&#39;d say &quot;tiny box Tim&quot; at some point, but then I realized how old this video is now :P"
Markiplier,I want a French accent... I want to hear Mark trying to be as good as French as he is with Spanish ^^
Markiplier,"nice mark please more amnesia tonight!!!!!!!!!
"
Markiplier,"dude your insane amount
 of content is amazing, best sub i ever made"
Markiplier,14:23-14:32 It&#39;s the LOST monster!! It even has those mechanical sounds just like in Lost!
Markiplier,Smoke monster from Lost? Lol this is an awesome custom story!
Markiplier,"Yes, I&#39;m fully aware :) I saw all 6 seasons, I was just saying whoever made this mod probably got inspiration from it :)"
Markiplier,Mark: I don&#39;t even know what it looks like<br>(Gets Hit)<br>Me: It looks like death!!      lol
Markiplier,12:21 It&#39;s actually kind of nice- especially for amnesia
Markiplier,"Interesting new monster...perhaps there will be more new ones, Since that world seems so different from earth I guess that shadow thing is actually a natural inhabitant there, thus its presence in the environmental studies area."
Markiplier,7:45 His chest burst! (remembering back to the flashback at the wine cellar maybe?)
Markiplier,"Mark sounds like the male narrator, awesome. "
Markiplier,"Heh, if only…Unfortunately, the Lost monster was Jacob&#39;s nameless brother, forever cursed for touching the Light. (Actually, they never really explained why Jacob&#39;s brother became that thing, sadly.)"
Markiplier,"I&#39;m pretty sure that was a laenerk thingy, the Creature (Invisible to humans) that is the land relative of the kaernerk monster mentioned in a note you picked up during the first episode. "
Markiplier,how many video&#39;s per day do you upload?! I am so happy I subbed... love your video&#39;s!
Markiplier,"I am still amazed by what the creator made, it&#39;s stunning."
Markiplier,"Is it even possible to do an English, Welsh, Scottish, and Irish accent all in one? Because, that&#39;s what a British accent would be if there was one."
Markiplier,This is a sweet mod.
Markiplier,So that chemical makes humans (realm 4) into the amnesia monsters?
Markiplier,all the while ive been watching these episodes ive been reading twokinds from marks brother
Markiplier,MOAR!!!
Markiplier,That&#39;s one cool lever xD
Markiplier,2 videos ! Mark Ur movies are so cool !
Markiplier,I wonder why the view count on this one is so low. Was this mod really unpopular or something? 
Markiplier,guess we know where the smoke monster from Lost came from! haha
Markiplier,wtf.... is this alexander&#39;s home world? i&#39;m getting lost with so many custom stories...
Markiplier,5:35 I saw what you did there mark
Markiplier,It would be cool to have a monster protecting u
Markiplier,Myth busted
Markiplier,"Why do I watch Mark&#39;s videos? It&#39;s simple. He&#39;s different. He&#39;s an expert on nailing games, yet he makes me laugh while he does so. His girly screams and whimpers never fail to entertain me, while his awesomeness and determination inspires me and makes me look up to him. There are Tobuscus and Pewdiepie, who are both famous and loved, but Mark does so much for his fans and always shows his appreciation. Mark, I just want you to know you&#39;re a one of a kind. Don&#39;t let people tell you otherwise."
Markiplier,"Okay, the seductive voice part just kind of killed me in a very, VERY good way."
Markiplier,"&quot;How did this guy manage to get enough money to buy a castle?&quot; <br>Mark, thats you now. Lordy"
Markiplier,"Best compliment ever, &quot;Your legs go on for a sufficient distance&quot; lol What I wouldn&#39;t give for such a nerdy compliment."
Markiplier,"Mark: &quot;Better concern bad words it for the kiddies.&quot;<br><b>Plays game with a bunch of naked man</b><br>Oh, Mark, I love your logic. Its why your the best. XD"
Markiplier,"Mark has one of theose voices you hear on the late night radio shows.<br>&#39;And now, it&#39;s time to put out the fire, cork the wine and get in bed with your man, because up next, is Boys II men with - I&#39;ll make love to you. Ahhhh yeah.&#39;"
Markiplier,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhrRAQ_KC8c&amp;t=49m33s"">49:33</a> every time he opens a door after hiding from a monster I imagine Walter (Jeff Dunham&#39;s puppet for those who don&#39;t know) saying &quot;SHUT THE DAMN DOOR!&quot;"
Markiplier,"Nyctophobia means fear of night or darkness. It is also known as Scotophobia.<br>Nyctophobia is present when you are frightened beyond more than the circumstances or object would cause.<br>And for these circumstances, there may be absolutely no reason whatsoever for you to be afraid about.<br>It is just that your mind exaggerates the condition that you are in and portrays it in such a way that causes you to think about it in a different kind of way that makes you scare yourself.<br>Hence developing your intense fear for that particular circumstances or object. With that development of intense fear of darkness or night, you would most probably avoid getting into those circumstances that you are afraid about and stay away from the object of your fear at all costs."
Markiplier,"I&#39;ve been going back and watching Mark&#39;s old videos in order, and every time he says &quot;Don&#39;t move, Kelsie.&quot; It kinda freaks me out. Haha."
Markiplier,"Maek is right, this was an amazing mod or custom story! In fact one of the best I have ever seen. Only (major) flaw, no notes or diary-entries. I kinda missed that, but level-design, ending, scares, &#39;missions&#39;, everything... just awesome (9,5/10; at least!)."
Markiplier,Seductive Mark always makes me burst out into laughter. :D 
Markiplier,"That was a great custom story, though I wish there was a bit more storyline. But still was awesome! Great video Mark!"
Markiplier,I love amnesia like crazy even though I never played it but I really do! this amnesia Livestream was the best I love it! including &#39;hipster Mark&#39; didn&#39;t know where that came from in the video but it was pretty funny.
Markiplier,"greatly enjoyed watching this live stream. i&#39;m so excited for the one next sunday ^ ^ you&#39;re amazing, mark &lt;3"
Markiplier,"I wasn&#39;t able to get to the live stream but you did an awesome job Mark, thank you."
Markiplier,i still remember watching this live stream few years ago and now rewatching it.
Markiplier,That was an amazing custom story! I wish I had Amnesia just to play that. 
Markiplier,"I was there! Great voice and great screams XD
You rock!! \m/"
Markiplier,"Watching old Markiplier videos brings back so many memories ^W^ It brings back why I love this man so, oh god I love him ^w^ I giggled through so much, and laughed so hard, you are the best Marki, I love you ^3^"
Markiplier,thanks to you telling us you were 23 in this video I took the liberty to add your age to the years leading up to right now resulting the revealing of your current age of 31 years I also took the liberty of calculating your age and subtracted by the current year revealing that you were born on that military base in Honolulu Hawaii in 1988 basically everyone Markiplier is 31 and was born in the late 80&#39;s am I right everyone?
Markiplier,"I absolutely love the name of this custom story, it tells u the custom story is going to be freaky scary and we get to watch Markipoo scream through the whole thing. Adore the accents Mark. It&#39;s sweet gives the game an awesome atmosphere! It gives the game a Markiplier atmosphere the best kind!!!!"
Markiplier,"So when going through your videos I always thought some of your phrases or jokes reminded me of Brian Regan, but I figured it was just because he&#39;s my favorite comedian. I&#39;m glad that someone else loves him as much as me! He never fails to make me laugh!"
Markiplier,Haha I love your old videos (: brings back so many memories!
Markiplier,I just love your voice &lt;3 
Markiplier,Great custom story WITH great commentary by Markiplier!
Markiplier,"I&#39;m not into Amnesia, but I definitely enjoyed this custom story. "
Markiplier,"That&#39;s the spirit! As long as you keep working hard at it, the audience will find you. Good luck ;)"
Markiplier,"I just checked out Brian Regan and i was only 15 seconds in the video and i was already pissing myself from laughter. Thank you Mark for helping us find this guy,he is HILARIOUS!"
Markiplier,"I love how Mark, when reading the intro, goes into a Scandinavian accent lol too funny"
Markiplier,He&#39;s the living embodiment of Johnny Bravo
Markiplier,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhrRAQ_KC8c&amp;t=48m32s"">48:32</a> &quot;John Freeman who was Gordon Freeman&#39;s brother&quot;<br>I didn&#39;t expect to hear this reference, but am delighted all the same. Full Life Consequences was a ride."
Markiplier,I laughed so hard when the monster was breaking the closet then mark tried to sneek past him and died lmao
Markiplier,I wonder if amnesia custom stories are still being made lately.
Markiplier,"Man, this video takes me back...feels like it was so long ago!"
Markiplier,"Mark, this video is great. I look forward to every new video you put out. :) I&#39;ve got the beginnings of a small crush on your voice. "
Markiplier,"Mark: Hello Germany! I&#39;m actually saying hello to all of Germany right now.
Me: (The Hetalian) *cracking up*"
Markiplier,"well it&#39;s 1 in the morning in my cold, dark basement and I&#39;m watching this for some reason...markiplier, you&#39;ve officially hooked me"
Markiplier,"This CS is so great, it should have a lot more views !"
Markiplier,You did an excellent job! :D
Markiplier,"omg this is just too funnyXD Markiplier,you made the main character look soooo smartXD The reasons why me and my best friend love you haha"
Markiplier,"Yay! =3

Another Amnesia Mod! Can&#39;t wait to watch it!"
Markiplier,"I died when he said,&quot;ohh your legs go on for..a sufficient distance...&quot; LOL"
Markiplier,oh god Mark your seductive voice is so creepy but at the same time its hilarious xD
Markiplier,most insane play through I have ever seen by markiplier
Markiplier,"Ahhh yess 2012 Markiplier.  This brings back so many memories, never gets old 6 years later and I still love this!!"
Markiplier,when he talked as seductive markiplier i bet tons of people fangirled so hard.
Markiplier,"i know you&#39;re conserving oil most the time, and thats smart, but sometimes when you&#39;re in darker areas, its hard to see what you&#39;re seeing, maybe at least use the lantern once in each darker area, so i get a sense of where you are, and believe me, i try hard to do that on my own, but you make me wanna play the amnesia games &gt;w&gt; "
Markiplier,That first closet monster scared the living crap outta me!!!
Markiplier,Mark you should totally be a radio presenter for a radio station that plays smooth Jazz or something chilling. 
Markiplier,"Also, for those who don&#39;t know, Rosetta is not a necromorph; Mark misunderstood that part. She&#39;s (supposedly) one of the aliens that used to live on Tau Volantis before the Markers took over."
Markiplier,"About the babies - rather than being driven by outrage over using infants as necromorphs(which is disturbing on many levels), it was actually more of a design decision. Most of the locations visited in dead space 3 are military in nature - military research facilities, derelict military fleet, military barracks, etc. The designers reasoned that there would not be many children or perhaps none at all at these locations, but that dogs were still plausible, thus the design was changed.<br><br>Very understandable to assume it was due to censorship, but considering the extremely graphic and horrific nature of these games, sensitivity to horrific themes is probably not that high on the list of reasons to change something from one game to the next."
Markiplier,Markiplier:eating on camera is unprofessional and even knows markiplier is professional!<br>Me:*watches his entire drunk minecraft series and he sits there eating on camera through season2*
Youtuber,Comments
jacksepticeye,"Thanks man, I will do. Thanks for watching :)"
jacksepticeye,I loved the part when jack said &quot;It&#39;s morbin time&quot; and then morbed all over the bad guys
jacksepticeye,You ARE first my friend :P Thanks for watching
jacksepticeye,"Man, this takes me back. I remember watching this back in the day, before the channel took off. Very much deserved, might I add. Truth be told, I didn&#39;t recognise Jack at all when I found this channel again. Quite the contrast.<br>Also: The bolt sniper is still easily my favorite. Just in terms of visuals and sound design."
jacksepticeye,LET’S ALL WATCH THIS VIDEO AND MAKE IT THE MOST POPULAR VIDEO ON THE CHANNEL<br><br>(why not)
jacksepticeye,"I&#39;m disappointed, only 400 people watched this since Jack uploaded his today&#39;s video."
jacksepticeye,I can&#39;t believe this games multiplayer is dead these days I freaking loved playing this games multiplayer...thank you so much Sean for having this wonderful video for my and everyone else&#39;s nostalgia
jacksepticeye,"Good old times, eh?<br><br>this is such a &quot;serious&quot; commentary compared to nowadays but you already told us that you are now really being yourself and I&#39;m glad that you were able to come this far :D"
jacksepticeye,Great video! :) keep it up
jacksepticeye,"Every gun is strong if you know how to aim with it:) the incinerator is just the hardest to master from all the rest at least IMO. Every other is just pure aim but with the incinerator there is the range drop and the angle you aim. <br>The xpac was the easiest for me to achieve the dog tag, after it was the incinerator and then others.. The most hard is getting pinch rifle or reaper canon headshots:/ <br>Love your videos dude :)"
jacksepticeye,"time fly&#39;s, 9 years... love your stuff man keep it up, or don&#39;t, whatever you need for your health I hope you know we, us, the community you raised, will support you."
jacksepticeye,"I feel like everyone has forgotten these old videos, when they are still very fun games played by the same Jackaboy!"
jacksepticeye,I came here from a recently posted video where he spins a wheel but it was fun to see his channel like this. Quite the nostalgic feeling.
jacksepticeye,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXuYxkiUutI&amp;t=0m02s"">0:02</a>- &quot;In this video, I am bringing you some alien weapons and their locations and how good they are.&quot; So a kind of expert analysis- cool.<br>End- You were very thorough, which is always appreciated. :) I learned a lot even though I will never play this game. ~"
jacksepticeye,We should make this one of the most watched after today&#39;s video lmfao
jacksepticeye,Wow this video is like a time capsule…<br>God bless all you guys for reminiscing with me :)
jacksepticeye,I&#39;m going back to his old vids because he now has 15 million subscribers. So proud😊😊😊
jacksepticeye,"Thanks so much for making this video, very helpful."
jacksepticeye,thanks for the tip love the content keep it up
jacksepticeye,"Wow, amazing video Jack!!! That&#39;s the best video you&#39;ve ever posted"
jacksepticeye,About to try watching all of his videos from oldest to newest. Part 77
jacksepticeye,"Lmao, I was trying to find Jack&#39;s least watched video and this was it. I&#39;m still finding it hard to believe one of Jack&#39;s videos is at 2,726 views, hilarious. xD"
jacksepticeye,Now lets make this his most popular video NOW! How funny would that be?
jacksepticeye,I wonder how many people who watched this back when it was uploaded still watch his videos to this day
jacksepticeye,Damn this is not really old but within the span of the past years he has grown tremendously
jacksepticeye,"His most unpopular video, this man does not deserve a most unpopular video 😂"
jacksepticeye,Only few will ever get to see Sean’s least viewed video. I’m glad to be one of them
jacksepticeye,Old but gold
jacksepticeye,"Hello Jack! Love your videos. Do you have any recommendations for a new youtuber? I have no idea what I&#39;m doing lol, but I love games and I love creating so I figured I&#39;d give it a shot. Thanks for being an inspiration."
jacksepticeye,Came because of the wheel stayed for the excellent content
jacksepticeye,Jack if you see this you lit up my life. So much of my childhood was watching your GTA videos and laughing my ass off-- I wish you and the whole community all the best. Btw if you see this can you clap once at the end of your next video?
jacksepticeye,"Hi Jack. Much like my comments on Mark&#39;s and Felix&#39;s least viewed videos, I know you or anyone else will probably never see this comment. However I&#39;m writing this for me. To keep myself motivated and to promise you I&#39;m going to catch up to you one day. Life is hard right now, but I will not waver in trying to entertain people and make them smile. And by writing this I&#39;m also promising to myself that I wont give up on my way there. I didn&#39;t know being a Youtuber could be so lonely."
jacksepticeye,Who’s here from his recent video?
jacksepticeye,You have now 20 million subscribers Jack. Love ya.
jacksepticeye,Thanks so much for the tip
jacksepticeye,"Hear that? This is back when Wall-E was running the channel, beautiful robotnics."
jacksepticeye,Okay this is epic
jacksepticeye,This is not gonna stay the least viewed video for long.
jacksepticeye,"It&#39;s weird seeing small view numbers from such a popular YouTuber.<br>But then again, this is an old video I decided to click on."
jacksepticeye,I&#39;m surprised that this didn&#39;t get a lot more views after that video he made lol
jacksepticeye,right now in March 2021 this is one of jacks smallest vids
jacksepticeye,I&#39;m still loving it
jacksepticeye,This is handy video. Now I know how to play game.
jacksepticeye,"Damn, still 9,8 K views after so long."
jacksepticeye,Let&#39;s make this popular!
jacksepticeye,Dude jack was awsome back then
jacksepticeye,"At the time of writing this comment, I’m 99% sure this is the least viewed video on his channel. This has 9209 views and the other couple that say 9.2k have slightly more"
jacksepticeye,"I did it guys. As of sunday 10. Feburary at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXuYxkiUutI&amp;t=19m47s"">19:47</a> (in my timezone), this is the least viewed video of jacks channel"
jacksepticeye,Congratulations you found it :D

jacksepticeye,"Hi Jack, i just wanted to thank you for uploading so much videos, you&#39;ve helped me through hard times and even let me smile in those hard times, I&#39;m not a subscriber for a long time, but you are surely one of the few I like! Thank you Jack!"
jacksepticeye,"Jack, you are such an awesome dude who inspires me to work towards my dreams. I love all of your content and even though you do curse... alot, you are still a guy who is beautiful in his soul. Thanks for being you..."
jacksepticeye,It&#39;s hilarious when jack gets so into this game and so hype! It&#39;s just crazy!
jacksepticeye,More of this game would be awesome.

Thank you for giving me that comfort and relaxation when i need it most."

jacksepticeye,“I’m really good at this!”<br><br>1 minute later<br><br>“I’m gonna get rekt.”
jacksepticeye,Jacks laugh is me leaving the hole of my room for the first time in a week and facing the sun.
jacksepticeye,"Jack: &quot;I&#39;m really good at this.&quot;<br><br>Me: <b>&quot;Ok, let me tell you everything wrong about that statement.&quot;</b>"
jacksepticeye,"Jack I haven’t been watching your vids in a while but I’m just in my feels right now thinking back on my child hood and I just need to thank you very much for everything you did for me all the laughs, getting scared watching outlast, all the sad moments and all the crazy moments. Thank you Sean"
jacksepticeye,"Didn&#39;t expected Jack to play Dauntless, that&#39;s cool"
jacksepticeye,Sean: This is what it’s like to be a gangster.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>storms in with a sword attack</b><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Sean: Oh God hes on fire
jacksepticeye,<b>&quot;I&#39;m like a sexy little ninja&quot;</b><br>Me: <b>sweating intensifies</b>
jacksepticeye,"Sean, your make all of us happy. Your videos are the reason we are able to get up in the morning and face a new day. We love you"
jacksepticeye,Today&#39;s fact: The collars on men&#39;s dress shirts used to be detachable. This was to save on laundry costs as the collar was the part that needed cleaning the most frequently.
jacksepticeye,Just stopped playing Dauntless for a moment to watch this and now there’s more Dauntless<br><br>Dauntless is great
jacksepticeye,Sean: don&#39;t I look like someone who knows what their doing?<br><br>Me: ...<br><br>Me: Shakes head no<br><br>Sean: pls say yes<br><br>Me: (IMMEDIATELY shakes head yes)
jacksepticeye,This game is honestly really cool. I really like the monsters in it.
jacksepticeye,&quot;I&#39;m absolutely ready&quot;<br>&quot;OK MAYBE I SHOULD LISTEN YOU TALK&quot;<br>-Jack
jacksepticeye,"Wishing everyone a very merry Christmas, hope you get all the presents on your list!"
jacksepticeye,As soon as the first fight started right away only one thing came to my mind &quot;Yikes forever&quot;  - Misfortune 2019 I hope you get better as you progress throughout the fights in the game Jack.  Erin go Bragh!!!
jacksepticeye,You REALLY need to play this again its SO fun watching you play this. Please do plat this some more.
jacksepticeye,ANYTHING BUT THE GAELIC GLADIATOR! RUN WHILE YOU CAN!<br><br><br><br>Love you Jack! You make the days pass easier and the hard times easier. Keep moving forward at your own pace and make sure to keep your PMA!
jacksepticeye,"Coming from a dauntless player, this man is genuinely good."
jacksepticeye,&quot;Youtube video: Includes paid promotion&quot;<br><br>Instantly me: its raid shadow legends
jacksepticeye,"Loving the new content on dauntless, almost have all the new weapons, I feel the armor is underwhelming but being able to equip any cell on the weapons is worth the grind if you&#39;re ever trying for a specific build."
jacksepticeye,Great game Sean. Thank you for sharing this.
jacksepticeye,You&#39;re really good at entertaining us.
jacksepticeye,The repeaters would be great for this cause you wouldn&#39;t have to get up close and personal with the monsters. You can&#39;t exploit their weaknesses though they charge type everytime and you can&#39;t change your equipment in between each fight.
jacksepticeye,Jack is the kinda guy to be sponsored and still talk about himself at the start instead of the game. 👏
jacksepticeye,Me: sees title &quot;I&#39;m REALLY good at this&quot;<br><br>My brain: what yelling and screaming non-sense 🤣
jacksepticeye,That laughter in the intro is gonna be a meme wether you like it or not.
jacksepticeye,It&#39;s national coffee day! <br><br><br><br><br>Also this game is adorable and I love it.
jacksepticeye,The part where seeing real people is the thing that scares Jack XD
jacksepticeye,This game is so cute
jacksepticeye,This game is so <b>cool</b><br>Get it? Because of the snow cones?<br>I&#39;ll go now
jacksepticeye,"Seeing jack play this game, jack being a complete kawaii potato, makes me wanna unleash my inner kawaii POTATO!!!!! Thanks jack!!! \(0•0)/"
jacksepticeye,"Jack: <b>Popcorn, popcorn, popc-</b> wait why aren&#39;t they writing back?<br>Snowcone: Hehe<br>Jack: Okay they wrote back I feel better now.<br><b>POPCORN, POPCORN, POPCORN!</b>"
jacksepticeye,Wow what a sweet random game xD
jacksepticeye,This game reminds me of &quot;I saw her standing there&quot; such a cute little game
jacksepticeye,The little snow cones are so cute and are really relatable 😂
jacksepticeye,I saw cookie cat and screamed. Got punched but it was worth it!
jacksepticeye,My crush sent me this video and texted &quot;I wish I was blue and you were pink&quot; we are now dating. Thank you jack!! You gave him the courage to say it!!
jacksepticeye,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-l_2UoeYU8&amp;t=4m30s"">4:30</a> HES A FROZEN TREAT WITH AN ALL NEW TASTE CAUSE HE CAME TO THIS PLANET FROM OUTER SPACE A REFUGGE OF AN INTERSTELLAR WAR BUT NOW HES AT YOUR LOCAL GROCERY STORE<br>COOKIE CAT"
jacksepticeye,love makes you blind and then you walk into a streetlamp XD
jacksepticeye,"Jack: my bits are falling of.<br><br>Me: okay then, that’s really nice to know"
jacksepticeye,I absolutely adore how excited he gets when he learns he can leave footprints while walking in a game.
jacksepticeye,The way he said &quot;Snow Angels~!!&quot; Was adorable dear lord. That made me so happy 😂
jacksepticeye,"When I saw that this came out I clicked on it so fast, gasped and said aloud- &quot;THE STORY CONTINUES!!!&quot; everyone stared at me and questioned me 😂"
jacksepticeye,Am I the only one that absolutely adores the soundtrack? It’s so cute and relaxing
jacksepticeye,"Welcome, Jacksepticeye. I&#39;ve been waiting."
jacksepticeye,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-l_2UoeYU8&amp;t=9m38s"">9:38</a> The facecam of Jack impersonating someone who can&#39;t find his mouth while eating popcorn made me laugh so hard. The little <b>pat</b> as he smacks his forehead... I love these Snow Cone-games, they are so sweet &lt;3"
jacksepticeye,that awkward moment when the snowcones have more chemistry than most relationships
jacksepticeye,"I know this was recorded some time ago, but I can’t help but always come back to watch this! This is the cutest EVER!"
jacksepticeye,&quot;i hope you all go out there and find your true snow cone in life&quot; best motivation line i&#39;ve ever heard
jacksepticeye,This game strokes the true romantic chord.    Tooth-rottin&#39;ly adorable.
jacksepticeye,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-l_2UoeYU8&amp;t=10m49s"">10:49</a> That is flipping ADORABLE"
jacksepticeye,A game that literally melts your heart - and a gamer that makes you feel like family each episode 👌🏼
jacksepticeye,This is the cutest series ever...I was drinking coffee when you uploaded this . Happy national coffee day Jack.
jacksepticeye,I love when he plays the cute games and he gets all soft and cute
jacksepticeye,I like how Jack goes from being all quiet (if that&#39;s possible for Jack) to loud like that will wake you up in the morning
jacksepticeye,"This is just so cute and adorable. Team LazerBeam has something good going for them if they keep up the cute, warm games like this. :D Keep up the fun, JAck. God bless yours and you! :)"
jacksepticeye,"You have Jacks intro, Nice warm calmmgame and then his outro... Not calm anymore!"
jacksepticeye,Jack gets so into these type of games.<br>It&#39;s adorable
jacksepticeye,"I can’t get over how adorable this game is, also please play more!"
jacksepticeye,I don&#39;t know why but I&#39;m imagining Jack as a tiny snow  cone. So adorable :)
jacksepticeye,"God, the game is so damn cute. Even the music makes me feel warm inside"
jacksepticeye,This game is so cute. They are the best couple. I really hope that there will be a part 3.<br><br>P.S. I now feel bad about eating ice cream while watching this.
jacksepticeye,If you see this jack please don&#39;t lose the jacksepticeye inside of you
jacksepticeye,Is it just me that loves really loves how loud Jack is?😂❤️
jacksepticeye,This series is strangley adorable

jacksepticeye,"If you liked 2033 you will love this. It&#39;s better in almost every single way. I adore both games :) and thanks man, appreciate your support"
jacksepticeye,Agreed :D
jacksepticeye,"Its interesting how every time you step from the car, Artyom hops out from the side the next searchable location is on"
jacksepticeye,Your PC was a similar build as yours and I built it at the same time and downloaded MLL as soon as download was available cuz I got it free with my graphics card. So great to watch you play. Thank you for all your wonderful videos.
jacksepticeye,Beat Metro 2033 last night! Can&#39;t wait to pick this one up! :) Great video haha
jacksepticeye,i was 13 when i got this game and i had arachnophobia..... i was trying to pass this level for 2 days and it beat the shit out of me :D
jacksepticeye,metro 2033 was a great game. this is an AWESOME game.
jacksepticeye,"&quot;This is not the Polar Express, I&#39;m not gonna take you to visit Santa claus.&quot;<br>I died laughing!"
jacksepticeye,About to try watching all of his videos from oldest to newest. Part 187
jacksepticeye,This was the first series<br>I watched
jacksepticeye,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrD9Bpmdogg&amp;t=0m16s"">0:16</a>- &quot;I&#39;m going to enjoy my experience in this game.&quot; Why anyone plays, or should play in the first place. To soak it all in.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrD9Bpmdogg&amp;t=0m45s"">0:45</a>- &quot;Are you guys seeing the same game I am?&quot; Probably not. YouTube tends to squish the videos. I have noticed that watching someone play and playing myself are often different visually. But this is still pretty good looking.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrD9Bpmdogg&amp;t=1m37s"">1:37</a>- (yells) :O I didn&#39;t know that there were jump-scares in this game! Watching on my big monitor and it looked like it was gonna get me.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrD9Bpmdogg&amp;t=5m28s"">5:28</a>- &quot;My headphones are set to 5.1...&quot; Sounds nice- literally. I forget what these ones are set to but they are Linsoul KZ ZS10 Pro. I love the way they sound!<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrD9Bpmdogg&amp;t=10m16s"">10:16</a>- Shit. Must be why that way was boarded up. ~"

jacksepticeye,"Sean, I&#39;m in nursing school I&#39;m broke BUT I&#39;ll be there with ALL of my support. You&#39;re such a great guy, much love ❤❤"

jacksepticeye,"Jack: higher donations will lead to fun giveaways!<br><br>Me, a jobless teenager: I can&#39;t even donate a dollar :&#39;)"
jacksepticeye,"I got my mom to love Jack because of how much he&#39;s raised and how much he actually cares about these charities. I can&#39;t believe she actually started watching a youtuber because she doesn&#39;t like youtube or anything like that, but when I told her about him and what he&#39;s doing she actually got really excited and happy that there are ppl like him out in the world and on the internet to be such good influences. So thank you very much, Jack, you&#39;ve done so much for this world and these charities."
jacksepticeye,"forget my own funeral, I may be dead but I am watching this stream!"
jacksepticeye,"Yayyyyyy!!! More charity, more donation, more positivity, more love. Let’s do this!!!!!"
jacksepticeye,"Been here since January 2014... Don&#39;t expect Jack to see this but you have changed SOOOO much since then.  First video of yours I saw was Overgrowth Part I video, kept coming back after that.  Don&#39;t know how many subs you had, I didn&#39;t even have a youtube account then but I&#39;ve loved seeing you change over time.  Keep up the great videos, you got me through some hard times in life, and now I&#39;m much happier than I was back then.  Feel like your channel was a contributing factor to helping me turn it around.  Thanks man, and even if you don&#39;t see this, I hope everyone who does has an amazing year.<br><br><br>Thanks again"
jacksepticeye,"You’re so kindhearted, Jack! Thank you for all of your charity livestreams, I’m really excited for this saturday :)"
jacksepticeye,"This isn&#39;t an official broadcast guys, but please listen;<br><br>Even if you can&#39;t donate, for one reason or another, make sure to spread the word that there&#39;s a charity stream. Post it, tell your friends, whatever, but try and tell everyone you can. If more people join the stream, there ia a greater chance someone will be able to donate. The JSE community is bigger than some countries, meaning the impact of one of these streams does a lot. Do what you can, and keep that positive mental attitude going!"
jacksepticeye,I always watch these charity live streams and I give as much as I can and keep what you do jack :)
jacksepticeye,Jack your a great person because you always do charity’s and are genuinely a great guy 👍
jacksepticeye,Seriously who the hell could dislike this?? Sean is so pure and wholesome and we don&#39;t deserve him :&#39;)
jacksepticeye,As a person who has been to an area where this happens this charity is AMAZING this didn’t happen to me but to my best friend and it’s hard seeing your bestie cry so I will be donating and I hope others do the same 😊😔
jacksepticeye,The elgato game capture has helped my gaming channel <b>immensely</b> !!!! I too completely support their equipment!!<br><br>Cant wait to join the stream Saturday! 🖤

jacksepticeye,Jack: you don&#39;t need to go to the wedding<br>Me: HOW THA HECK DO YA KNOW?!? <br><br>I&#39;ll try to go and watch😊😊
jacksepticeye,These charity live streams are one of the pages in our neverending book of Why we love Jack.
jacksepticeye,"There was another exit when you were on the moving rectangle that led you to the fire. When you jump down, Nigel will say &quot;I&#39;m so glad you did not have to die. Just give me a minute. Then he sends you up the elevator and apparently thats the good ending."
jacksepticeye,"Everyone keeps telling me there&#39;s a good ending, I know, I said it in the video. But I won&#39;t be doing it in a video myself, the idea of a let&#39;s play to me is to experience the story one way and face whatever happens that way and move on. Instead of doing every single ending"
jacksepticeye,"Jack, In the good ending, you manage to shut the fire pit and Nigel sets you free, in a sad sort of way.<br><br><br>SPOILER!<br>He doesn&#39;t actually set you free, it&#39;s one of his stage props."
jacksepticeye,"THE MEMORIES D&#39;: That was such a cool game, deserves a <b>highfive</b> :)"
jacksepticeye,Your being to nice to everybody that&#39;s why we respect you so much! We all apreciate it thanks Jack
jacksepticeye,"Hey jack I know you don&#39;t wanna do another video of the alternate ending, But I think if you get some free time you should do the alternate ending. Just in your own free time and you don&#39;t need to make the video because I think you are missing out."
jacksepticeye,This is one of my favorite portal games you&#39;ve ever played and I&#39;m watching it in 2017
jacksepticeye,"Jack! I&#39;m back from the dentist today and my gums are still numb. Despite all the bothering, YOU CHEERED ME UP! Thanks for your epic vids Jack!<br>:D"
jacksepticeye,"Really dug this, man! Like you said, it&#39;s a true shame that viewership drops off so heavily with most series, but I&#39;m glad to see you trying to fit them in now and then - especially when the game is this unique and fun :)<br><br>Thanks for all you do, dude! :D"
jacksepticeye,"Wow, you are just so amazing, You reply to lots of comments, make tons of videos for different kinds of titles and audiences, and it just simmers this channel down to one that is and really deserves how popular it is right now, i thank you for existing. (Sorry if that sounded weird. lol)"
jacksepticeye,It&#39;s weird seeing Jack knowing and doing what he&#39;s supposed to do
jacksepticeye,"I found it hysterical at <a href=""http://youtu.be/O0PzxDnC_Ow?t=6m33s"">6:33</a> when  Jack forgot about the blue and set the cube on it after aiming the laser, and bounced up. I nearly died when I played it in slow speed and watched the cube bounce out of view before Jack looked at it 😂"
jacksepticeye,Hey Jack! YOUR A BOSS!!! Love your vids.
jacksepticeye,"This was a great series.  I wish it was longer.  Don&#39;t you wish there was more to play, Sean?"
jacksepticeye,Man I really liked this series. WHY DOES IT HAVE TO END!! 
jacksepticeye,Congrats on everything so far Jack. Nothing like punching that like button
jacksepticeye,"I loved this series Jack, great job. Keep making funny videos and making everyone laugh man"
jacksepticeye,"I love your videos man!  You are just so funny,  You always brighten up my day!"
jacksepticeye,"For your next Oculus Rift game, I would love to see you test out &quot;The Chair&quot; on the DK2! The visuals look stunning, lots of different experiences packed into one, and just think it would be a really neat DK2 experience!"
jacksepticeye,Hey Jack! I really loved the aperture tag series! Wonder what game is next for the #1 BOSS to play! 
jacksepticeye,In addition to all the puzzles and paint this game can also make for one hell of a drinking game! Just take a drink every time Nigel uses the word &quot;so&quot;.
jacksepticeye,jack your vids are amazing and it is no wonder why your subs are increasing so quickly you deserve them all
jacksepticeye,i loved this series. I wish there was more.
jacksepticeye,"Dear Jack you are my favorite youtuber. I&#39;m one of your biggest fan ever and I love you so so much because you make me laugh and happy. You, make beter lifes everyday with your videos you made my life hilarous too. We (your subs) can&#39;t imagine how BOSS are you. My words are finished to explain how hilarous, incredible, fantastic, magnificent and a lot of this things are you. Hopefully one day I can go to Ireland and meet with you and it&#39;s one of my biggest wish ever.

jacksepticeye,"Jacksepticeye&#39;s videos really bring the true meaning to &#39;dieing of laughter&#39;....because i am a victim of a near death experience of watching the legend, the boss, the one and only JACKSEPTICEYE"

jacksepticeye,"Jack, i have a felling that you and the boss army will keep growing rapidly and be the bosses of youtube!"
jacksepticeye,Love you jack you have let me get though some hard times is just want to say thank you so much for making brilliant videos
jacksepticeye,Hi jack just wanted to say a HUGE congratulations on hitting 900k subs that&#39;s mind blowing. You are so close to 1 million now and I am very proud of you mate. WELL DONE JACK !!!!!!!
jacksepticeye,Reading your comments: what do you think about people hating on others In the comments for playing or suggesting certain games
jacksepticeye,"Hey jack, I just wanted to tell you that my life sucks.i get bullied at school, I have no friends and my parents are getting a divorce. Whenever I feel sad and depressed I go to my room, sit on my bed and watch your videos. You help me escape reality and make me think that there is more to life than just sarrows. You are so funny and I love how you are always happy. Keep making videos because you are THE BOSS at it. I don&#39;t know what I would do without you &lt;3. Thank you for all you do for me and everyone elts who loves you :)"
jacksepticeye,jack: &quot;don&#39;t have kids they are weird&quot;<br><br><br><b>the entire population drops down 95%</b>
jacksepticeye,"&quot;and-a one, and-a two, and-a one, two, three, four!&quot; <br><br><b>children sink into the depths of the murky water</b>"
jacksepticeye,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM9bTmCAUr0&amp;t=9m19s"">9:19</a><br>Me: turns up my volume to hear the kids sing<br>Jack:  <b>SCREAMS</b><br>Me: Thank you, this is the quality content I signed up for"
jacksepticeye,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM9bTmCAUr0&amp;t=6m34s"">6:34</a><br>Jack: I&#39;m bleeding children<br><br><br>Me: That happens to me every month"
jacksepticeye,"My interpretation: This is about mob mentality and virtues. To me it&#39;s clear that those &quot;kids&quot; that, before being born swam against the grain, became creative, artistic and could express themselves. They were free thinkers. One of those &quot;free souls&quot; then was born and was singled out as a weirdo, an outsider. The unison-clapping mob&#39;s virtues and values didn&#39;t resonate with him or her, so him/she was exiled to go back to the hole (which either means conformity or death). Either way, for the first time you see that the non-conformist was reticent about falling down the hole like everyone else, thus why you had to forcefully drag them down.<br>I&#39;m guessing the few &quot;kids&quot; deciding which way to go are leaders or politicians which directed the mob right after."
jacksepticeye,Jack: Did I kill kids?<br><br>Jack: This is a fun game
jacksepticeye,Kids: <b>*start falling in a hole*</b><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Jack: <b>”This is beautiful”</b>
jacksepticeye,"It represents the ever-changing mentality that is of impressionable children, and influences society has on them. They are all moving fluid like a stream, all flowing down the same path, flying in an endless space of lives that have meaninglessly lived and produced in the same natural pattern of the children before them."
jacksepticeye,"&quot;Your body has many sphincters, just pick one.&quot;<br>-Jacksepiticeye 2019"
jacksepticeye,Jack: I’m going to carve my name in children <br><br>Wall Street journal: HE&#39;S CONDONING MURDER!
jacksepticeye,"Everyone else: <b>Singing beautifully</b><br>Sean: AGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br><br>Always that one kid, huh?"
jacksepticeye,"My observation of the game&#39;s message/story is that all the kids were spiraling into a hole of depression. The parts where Jack has to point all the children in one direction symbolizes conformity in today&#39;s society. Their later falling into the hole represents their descent into depression because they are repressing who they really are.  Swimming through the darkness may signify the kids trying to find their way in the world. It&#39;s hard to find their way since everything looks and feels the same all around them. The slimy canal things I feel represent literal birth canals in a mother&#39;s womb, and this may signify that the children are seeking help and finding their way as if being reborn. When they come out and splat on the ground, they&#39;re no longer in a state or phase of depression. But then the cycle begins again. These days you won&#39;t find many games like this. They usually have their own fictional storyline that attracts the player in some other way. Games like &quot;Kids&quot; send out a kind of message of awareness. There really should be more games like this. So what I believe this game is trying to say is: Stay true to yourself. Don&#39;t let others tell you who you are &quot;supposed&quot; to be.<br><br><br>Then again, what do I know? I&#39;m just a teenager who likes to watch screaming adult men wearing headphones lol<br>Jack if you read this please know that I don&#39;t intend that as an insult you are a wonderful human being XD<br><br><br><br><br>But seriously, everyone: If you are struggling with depression and/or have had thoughts or actions of suicide, please seek professional help immediately. A counselor&#39;s job is to help their client. If you need to talk to someone, find out the national suicide hotline in your country and contact them. They are there to help as well.<br><br><br>Wow okay this comment was long ima show myself out now byeeeeeee~"
jacksepticeye,Sean: Am I a genocidal maniac?!!! <br>(2 seconds later)<br><br>Sean: This is a fun game
jacksepticeye,"&quot;Everyone into Sean&#39;s hole now!&quot;<br><br><br><b>&quot;That&#39;s him, Officer!&quot;</b>"
jacksepticeye,"Jack&#39;s almost 30? oh dear, I&#39;M about to have a midlife crisis."
jacksepticeye,Jack- &quot;Imma spin you around&quot;<br>Me- You spin me right round baby right round..
jacksepticeye,"The reason Jacksepticeye would ever have kids is to get to name them for this phrase:<br><br>&quot;Anna One, Anna Two, Anna One, Two, Three, Four&quot;"
jacksepticeye,don&#39;t you remember what being a kid was like? That game pretty much sums it up lol
jacksepticeye,<b>kids falling to their deaths</b><br><br><br>Jack: This is beautiful.
jacksepticeye,"&quot;Everybody in Sean&#39;s hole now&quot;<br>~ Jack, 2019"
jacksepticeye,Sean: &quot;THIS IS RACISM!&quot;<br><b>Litterally everyone is the same</b>
jacksepticeye,"I think I know what this is about, although that might just be my brain looking for patterns that aren&#39;t there.<br><br>I think this is a story about, well, kids. The small, blank figures that make up the kids in this game--from the young voices to their behavior, that&#39;s pretty clear.<br><br>What got my attention was in the middle of the game, when a single kid fell into the crowd from nowhere. They all stood away from him, leaving an empty space around him and stared, because he wasn&#39;t part of the crowd, he was different.<br><br>I think this is a game about the nature of kids."
jacksepticeye,"&quot; <b><i>oh, nevermind, you&#39;re all dying.</i></b> &quot;<br><br>~ <i>Jacksepticeye 2019</i>"
jacksepticeye,"“Do you ever just wake some days and and you’re like what the shi- wha- what the Fock is goin on?” <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM9bTmCAUr0&amp;t=10m24s"">10:24</a> yes, yes I do."

Youtuber,Comments
Dream,SUBSCRIBE! if you&#39;re reading this you are contractually obligated to subscribe...
Dream,The fact that Dream straight up banished them to the shadow realm is gold
Dream,dream: gets 2 god apples<br><br><br>also dream: WHY IS THERE NO FLINT
Dream,Hunters: What do you have now<br>Dream: Confidence<br>Also Dream :The nether roof trap
Dream,"Dream finding 2 flint and steel at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=35m52s"">35:52</a> while the hunters are stuck in the nether is just comedic gold"
Dream,I wish we had been able to see the hunters&#39; perspective while they were trapped on the Nether roof. I think it would have been entertaining to watch George try and stop Sapnap from killing Ant
Dream,"The irony of Bad not wanting to follow dream into the nether for fear of a trap, which gives Dream the chance to mine the portal, then go into the other portal Dream set up unhesitantly (saying to go in together even). A lovely symphony of doom."
Dream,Dream trying to make a cobblestone crafting table is the equivalent of me looking in the refrigerator for the 10th time to look for invisible food
Dream,"Now that Manhunt is over, I can safely say that the TNT Nether trap is easily among the top 5 Manhunt moments ever."
Dream,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=34m24s"">34:24</a> to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=34m45s"">34:45</a> is the moment I subscribed. And the confliction behind them deciding if they should kill each other to escape afterward... probably the greatest trap, both physically and psychologically, that I&#39;ve ever seen Dream create. Bra. Vo."
Dream,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=34m23s"">34:23</a> Let&#39;s just ignore the fact that Dream ran at least 50 blocks away from the portal, lost sight of it, and then ran sideways before throwing three pearls STRAIGHT back to the portal. Man&#39;s got an invincible inner compass."
Dream,I love how dream literally banishes them to the nether roof and the rest of the game is just smooth sailing
Dream,His traps makes this feel like Home Alone and I’m living for it
Dream,"George when Dream is at 9.5 hearts: “Get him! He’s got to be low”<br>George when Dream is one sneeze in his general direction away from death: “okay, I’m just running”"
Dream,"The Nether Roof scene is such a perfect scenario for animatics and animations, Dream really made it better by finding the literal <i>perfect</i> music to edit it with."
Dream,"I like how, in all of these, Dream always shouts &quot;leave me alone!&quot; at the start of every video. Always makes me wonder if, maybe one day, they&#39;re like, &quot;hmm... okay&quot;"
Dream,"In theory, the Prot IV team could have placed a ton of blocks somewhere on the bedrock to make an area for ghasts to spawn, like ppl do with ghast farms. Probably would have worked, but of course they seemed pretty green on the way the top of the nether works so they couldn&#39;t&#39;ve known. Still interesting to think about"
Dream,Dream is the definition of quality over quantity.
Dream,"I love how he just not disappoints us, even if we were the ones hating on him and making him so much trouble, I think everyone of the community, exclusively the community on twitter should feel very sorry"
Dream,"I started to play Minecraft with my two daughters like two years ago and never understood, how could watching somebody play be entertaining. Well, watching this is like watching olympic athletes compete - but with the added layer of incredible tactic and strategy. We are totally hooked.<br>I simply love how Dream as well as the hunters are devising incredible strategies that I would never have thought of, pulling them off with incredible speed. Keep it up!"

Dream,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=19m40s"">19:40</a> It&#39;s crazy to think it has been 2 years. I still come back to these videos for moments like this and just pure aww with how tables turn, how Dream clutches through these situations. Damn these were fun to watch..."
Dream,"dream, at the beginning of every manhunt: <b>now here is a little lesson in trickery</b>"
Dream,"When Dream begins to construct a furnace crafting table, you can see he&#39;s in a panic."
Dream,Dream went from sounding so helpless to confident saying &quot;come fight me.&quot;  that&#39;s the dream we love
Dream,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=21m43s"">21:43</a> Dream approaches a Wither Skeleton with 47 cooked porkchops. The scene then clips forward to him inside the fortress, with only 44 cooked porkchops. Rewatching it I suddenly wonder find myself wondering just how badly that fight went XD"
Dream,bad: dream is probably cowering rn <br><br>dream: coming up with the most genius plan ever to nether trap them
Dream,Every once in a while I feel like dream is just trolling the hunters 😂
Dream,I love how dream was being big brain and then he spent like 5 seconds trying to make a crafting table out of cobblestone
Dream,"When Dream starts running, you second guess yourself, with a shiver down your spine. When he says he wants to fight, you run for your life."
Dream,Bad: I&#39;m gonna kill you with bread Dream!<br>Dream in the 5 hunters series: Kills hunters with bread
Dream,I&#39;m rewatching all of the manhunt and I think this is my favorite one! The clutches are so smart and my heart is literally beating so fast the entire time from the intensity lmao.
Dream,"I love how as soon as George asked &quot;How are we like, gonna be getting out of here?&quot; Dream started pearling back to the portal."
Dream,"Desert temple play: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=2m00s"">2:00</a><br>Minecart with tnt play: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=5m13s"">5:13</a><br>Dream forgets his flint and steel: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=8m39s"">8:39</a><br>Desert temple play 2 attempt: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=12m51s"">12:51</a><br>Nether wall hiding: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=17m40s"">17:40</a><br>Antfrost beds: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=19m14s"">19:14</a><br>Sapnap failed bed attempt: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=19m40s"">19:40</a><br>Prot IV plan: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=24m44s"">24:44</a><br>On the Nether roof: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=31m40s"">31:40</a><br>New portal: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=32m16s"">32:16</a><br>Nether portal trap: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=33m40s"">33:40</a><br>Betrayal of prot IV: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=35m24s"">35:24</a><br>End wall hiding: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=40m41s"">40:41</a><br>Dragon one-cycle: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=43m54s"">43:54</a>"
Dream,"When Dream starts to sound frustrated and gets quiet, that when you know he&#39;s planning something good."
Dream,"The nostalgia, I still remember watching this mere hours after it was released with my friends and being so hyped about the insane plays. And now it’s been a year already."
Dream,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=25m39s"">25:39</a> at this point starts to be an arena, and after that, the Speedrun starts again"
Dream,after seeing what he looks like it really brings more emotion into what he’s doing imo
Dream,Anyone else re-watching all of the manhunts after the speed-runner v 5 hunters finale rematch?
Dream,honestly Ant sacrificing himself by blowing up the temple was such a smart play. would&#39;ve worked if he hadn&#39;t gotten a god apple
Dream,The Hunters: You can&#39;t kill us.<br>Dream: Sapnap can.
Dream,i find it very funny how they always enchant even though almost every time it ends up helping dream instead of them
Dream,"lmao i like how after dream killed everyone after the tnt thing,  they&#39;re just struggling to find dream while dream is just playing happy music"
Dream,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtuA5HWFoU&amp;t=34m20s"">34:20</a> No matter how much time goes by, this bit always gets my adrenaline running. Just so well edited with the awesome pumped up music."
Dream,i just love the irony of the flint and steel being what the hunters need and dream passing two alone in a chest
Dream,"&quot;What else could he have gotten?&quot;<br>&quot;One thing.&quot;<br>&quot;What?&quot;<br>&quot;Confidence.&quot;<br><br>Most boss thing ive ever heard, deadass."
Dream,"The duality of dream<br><br>“Fight me, I’m ready”<br>“LEAVE ME ALONE”"
Dream,"Subscribe, you can always change your mind later :)"
Dream,Dream: We coded this AI to know the perfect way to track us<br><br>Dream 5 minutes later: The grass is confusing him
Dream,This is how dream practices for manhunts when he&#39;s alone.
Dream,I love how George just randomly starts shrieking when he’s being chased
Dream,I can’t believe how much fun Dream is having meanwhile George is absolutely killing his voice by screaming the whole time 😅
Dream,"Watching Dream and George yell in terror, run into each other like idiots, die laughing, and go completely manic with panic is the hilarious."
Dream,I like how dream is just cooking food while George is being chased and screaming every 2 seconds
Dream,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O60zJzhYGEA&amp;t=0m48s"">0:48</a> &quot;hes so fast,  he places blocks exactly where they go, he knows the perfect routes, he knows exactly where to go.&quot; so basically dream.                                           (Got a good old fashioned debate in the replies here.)"
Dream,The fact that the terminator’s name is “OoogaBoooga” makes the whole tracking thing 10x more scarier
Dream,"Let’s just take the time to appreciate the fact that dream destroyed him at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O60zJzhYGEA&amp;t=17m25s"">17:25</a>"
Dream,"These two compete in most of their videos, but watching them celebrate together at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O60zJzhYGEA&amp;t=14m36s"">14:36</a> is worth rewinding for"
Dream,“He always takes the best routes and always places blocks perfectly”<br><b>first thing he does is jump off a cliff</b>
Dream,George’s accent makes everything he says and complains about 10X better 😂
Dream,George when dream is in trouble: “I’m coming I’m coming”<br>Dream when George is in trouble: “I’m getting wood”
Dream,"I&#39;d love to see a revisit. Dream made many mistakes in this one, things he&#39;d be more experienced with today."
Dream,George: <b>Is literally dying</b><br><br>Dream: This is comedy gold
Dream,I&#39;ve never seen Dream and George work together better than this.
Dream,George: DREAM HELP<br>Dream: - doesn&#39;t help him-wheezing*<br>Dream: GEORGE HELP<br>George:I&#39;m coming I&#39;m coming
Dream,"Finally, Dream gets a taste of his own medicine."
Dream,Dream: &quot;I&#39;ll distract him in the first part&quot;<br><br><br>George: <b>gets chased the entirety of the first five minutes</b>
Dream,Dream: The grass confuses him<br>Also Dream: There&#39;s no way we can outsmart him
Dream,Dream: <b>trying to run from Terminator in cramped mineshaft</b><br><br>Cobweb: And I took that personally.
Dream,"Dream has really grown as a player, I&#39;d love to see him try this again with his new skill!"
Dream,it brings me joy watching Dream and George play together lol such a nice duo.
Dream,"I feel like you&#39;ve both gotten more skilled by now, you should do this again"
Dream,Never has the sound of dirt being placed been more terrifying
Dream,I wish they’d bring this back. These challenges are nostalgic to watch for the channel
Dream,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O60zJzhYGEA&amp;t=4m31s"">4:31</a> this part where George is literally destroying his vocal cords made me laugh so hard 😂<br>(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O60zJzhYGEA&amp;t=5m55s"">5:55</a>)"
Dream,Now Dream knows how it feels like to be chased by Dream.
Dream,It&#39;s just like regular manhunt except all the &quot;Oh DreEEEEeeeEEEEaaam!&quot; and George dying is replaced by actual cooperation
Dream,George: <b>screaming in fear while being chased</b><br><br>Dream: <b>laughing maniacally and watching from a distance</b>
Dream,"I feel this would be interesting if the terminator could die. Like when it landed in lava in the Nether, it has to go back to spawn and chase them down again. Might be too hard to program into Baritone though."
Dream,Terminator after Dream<br>Dream: &quot;George help!&quot;<br>George: &quot;I&#39;m coming!&quot;<br><br>Terminator after George<br>George: &quot;HELP!&quot;<br>Dream: Just laughs
Dream,"George&#39;s scream at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O60zJzhYGEA&amp;t=4m38s"">4:38</a> was gold tier lmao"
Dream,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O60zJzhYGEA&amp;t=4m38s"">4:38</a> If you want to hear some strange noises from George, you must trap him inside a bedrock box with a killer robot"
Dream,Let&#39;s take a minute to talk about how they called a fortress a stronghold and a stronghold an &quot;end fortress&quot;
Dream,Dream: “I JUST OWNED HIM” <br>Also Dream a second later: <b>*fighting for his life*</b>
Dream,The fact that they called the fortress the &quot;stronghold&quot; made me loose my sanity for just a second.
Dream,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O60zJzhYGEA&amp;t=00m01s"">00:01</a> Dream vs Terminator AI is like Boba Fett vs IG-88. While the droid is perfect memory and coordination, the human is more experienced and adaptive."
Dream,Dream: he plays blocks perfectly and knows exactly where to go<br>Me: <b>doesn’t read the video title and thinks Dream has a twin</b>
Dream,Dreams wheezing and George’s screaming makes the funny 10x hilarious
Dream,George: <b>Struggles for his life</b><br><br><br>Dream: <b>Meanwhile being a professional cooker cooking some porkchop</b>
Dream,The terminator skin is so terrifying if I was doing this challenge I probably would have had a heart failure only 10 minutes in... also the ongoing comments show this is still super popular.
Dream,just put a dream skin on that terminator and now dream knows how it feels like to be chased by dream
Dream,"Whenever Dream was towering up in the desert temple, I was afraid that when he&#39;d look up, the terminator would be there staring at him with it&#39;s sword."
Dream,It would be fun to see you guys take all your challenges and try to do a single speed run with all of them on
Dream,Knew that spiderweb would be potentially deadly for one of the two parties in the end. The OP strat would be to use a daylight-pearl machine to teleport
Dream,Dream: &quot;This guy calculates the quickest route to get to us. He&#39;s sooo fast.&quot;<br><br>OogaBoooga: <b>bridges over a flat land surface with dirt</b>
Dream,George&#39;s panic shrieks are just 👌
Dream,There&#39;s no way they didn&#39;t realize one of them could&#39;ve just distracted it at the lake forever (since it can&#39;t swim) while the other one beats the game and drops by every once in a while to bring the lake distractor guy food.
Dream,problem with george: laughs when he is close to dream<br>problem with dream: stays dead silent when he is close to george
Dream,George is the embodiment of that giddy feeling you get when you get away with something
Dream,Dream missing a jump is like missing a heart beat.
Dream,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=2m58s"">2:58</a><br>George: How did you catch me!<br>Dream: YES!<br>George: How did you catch me!<br>Dream: YES!<br><br><br><br>*just completely ignoring George by celebrating"
Dream,imagine being george&#39;s neighbor and just hearing &quot;NO&quot; being screamed every few days
Dream,Can we appreciate how George gave Dream a flower at the beginning :D
Dream,"Dream breaking the ice with an axe was the most terrifying, disturbing, and quite frankly horrifying, part of this whole video."
Dream,Does anyone else tense up all of their muscles when dream just barely makes it out alive
Dream,“Your mom is mine”<br>Best dream quote by far
Dream,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=1m01s"">1:01</a> Dream laugh<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=1m38s"">1:38</a> George evil laugh<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=6m20s"">6:20</a> Round 4, Dream almost gets George<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=8m32s"">8:32</a> Dream jukes George<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=11m47s"">11:47</a> easy w for Dream<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=17m43s"">17:43</a> George spat…<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=20m24s"">20:24</a> “YÊÆS” George"
Dream,Dream: &quot;Just one more and I win!&quot;<br>Everyone: <b>Checks time and see theres 10 minutes left</b><br>Everyone: &quot;Phew&quot;
Dream,Spider: <b>Saves Dream by sacrifice</b><br>Dream: That dumb Spider! <br>Spider: :&#39;)
Dream,"George: You blend in with this biome really well<br>Dream: No I dont, I&#39;m green<br>George: I am c o l o r b l i n d"
Dream,"Well at least we know something.<br><br>When Dream is silent, you know he&#39;s near you<br><br>When George is laughing, you know he&#39;s near you"
Dream,Let&#39;s appreciate the fact that Dream lost twice due to fall damage.
Dream,"They should TOTALLY do this again sometime, now that challenges are supposedly returning."
Dream,&quot;Your mom is mine&quot;<br>best line 2020
Dream,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=10m46s"">10:46</a> made me scream from the shock of Dream falling and George coming out of absolute nowhere 😂"
Dream,me: sees dream being close to hitting george<br>also me: <b>lowers volume</b>
Dream,The days where dream and george were basically equal in skill..
Dream,I love how they were gambling their moms phone numbers.
Dream,“I’ll give you my mom’s phone number”<br>George: <b>starts dancing merrily</b>
Dream,It gives me Anxiety when dreams misses a jump
Dream,"HILARIOUS MOMENTS <br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=1m02s"">1:02</a> Kettle.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=6m28s"">6:28</a> Pig George.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=11m40s"">11:40</a> I like how George giggles like a 6 year old girl.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=11m48s"">11:48</a> When a little girl shouts when the light are off."
Dream,"I love how they don’t care about the 1,000 dollars just care about texting each other’s mother"
Dream,George : &quot; I have no blocks &quot;<br>Youtube subtitles : &quot;I have no drugs ! &quot;
Dream,"They need to make another one of these videos, they’ve both gotten so much better at the game."
Dream,i love dream&#39;s laugh when he told george about knowing their mom&#39;s number
Dream,George&#39;s little giggles make me so happy
Dream,Dream : makes a boat while in the air and then clutch<br>Also Dream : breaks ice with an axe even if he has a pickaxe
Dream,Dream: Makes insane get aways<br><br>Also Dream: Jumps to his death
Dream,"I love how george spins after knowing that he can get dream&#39;s mum&#39;s phone number <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=0m43s"">0:43</a>"
Dream,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=13m55s"">13:55</a> He puts intense music to make us think George is going to pull something, and I love that SO much"
Dream,Are we going to ignore that George said &quot;the radius of the square&quot; good sir are you okay?
Dream,"But honestly these two have nice chemistry anyway, i feel like im chilling when i watch them"
Dream,"Am I the only one who genuinely gets excited when Dream posts? Like actually, all of his content is original and super entertaining (George too!)"
Dream,Dream: hides in a supa dupa spot<br>Also dream: places a piece of cobble beside him
Dream,"Last record for George&#39;s demonic screams: 8/10. Today, we see a 11/10. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=11m47s"">11:47</a>"
Dream,Feels like luck was with George this match😄<br>Then again Dream is literally a master of creativity
Dream,I am going to take this moment to appreciate the strength of George&#39;s lungs.
Dream,George’s laugh of victory is so cute&lt;3
Dream,"I just imagine their moms talking about how proud they are of them, whilst they’re wagering their moms numbers and 1000 dollars over tag"
Dream,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=11m47s"">11:47</a> This moment shows that this is one of George&#39;s true fears"
Dream,Dream: no one can beat me at manhunt<br>George: but I can beat you at tag
Dream,Dreams laugh is funnier than the reason why he’s laughing
Dream,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=17m45s"">17:45</a> the way George is trying to tag Dream is funny 😂"
Dream,I love how intense chases are it makes it so intertaining
Dream,I like how they’re more worried about giving away their moms number than losing $1000
Dream,The way George&#39;s giggles contrast so much to his demonic screaming kills me😂😂<br><br>Yooo pogg! Thanks for the likes😂🙌
Dream,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEmLyLBEQHc&amp;t=17m47s"">17:47</a> THE WAY HIS ARM WRIGGLED WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO CATCH DREAM, ITS SO CUTE LMAO"
Dream,Alternate title: beating Minecraft without going deaf from sapnap screaming
Dream,Love how Bad is just the equivalent of a four-year-old on a leash
Dream,I&#39;m so proud of Bad for getting so good at being a nuisance
Dream,"I&#39;m actually really impressed by Bad&#39;s ability to not only troll his captor(s) by stealing items and getting himself stuck, but also killing them through loopholes in fhe game mechanics. Burning the fence post, swimming deep underwater, using beds in the nether, and I&#39;m not even halfway through as of writing this."
Dream,Dream: getting tired of bad&#39;s shenanigans<br>George and Sapnap: enjoying the scenery of nature
Dream,"What a horrific ending. Lol. Just dragging this man towards a portal by a rope around his neck to feed him to a dragon. He’s kicking and screaming, begging for his life, clawing at every block while his captors cheer and laugh."
Dream,"I love how everyone is just speaking normally, and then there&#39;s Sapnap screaming, voice cracking in the background 😂"
Dream,"I really loved this video from him! It does feel just enough like a throwback to manhunt without taking completely from it. I do think limiting the hostage’s abilities would be best, but I don’t think they should completely take away everything (honestly some of my favorite parts were Bad’s own escapes). Not sure what he’ll change, but excited to see more!"
Dream,"This has been arguably the funniest video from Dream ever, I couldnt stop laughing I hope there&#39;s gonna be another one where Dream is the hostage"
Dream,This would be a genuinely really good movie idea. Imagine an action movie where three different entities want the same person for different reasons and the entire movie is three assassins fighting over the hostage.
Dream,bad never ceases to impress with his intelligence
Dream,"I didn&#39;t expect this video to be so good!<br>It isn&#39;t as intense as a manhunt, but equally as fun to watch :D<br><br>I like the fact that Bad got the chance to show his intellect and cunning."
Dream,Bad being a burden for both sides is the most hilarious thing I’ve witnessed this night.
Dream,Dream literally sounds so exhausted when he&#39;s in charge of Bad lmao
Dream,"Dream telling bad to give stuff and he’ll make the most out of it WAS INCREDIBLE + his fast thinking. Also, props to Bad for killing + escaping them in so many different ways! And of course congratulations to George and Sapnap, they won many incredible battles!"
Dream,What a great friend group. No matter how much they scream they still manage to somehow tolerate eachother
Dream,"I love how instead of being so concentrated on battle and winning they actually fooled around and made me laugh, really makes it more entertaining. looking forward to these kind of videos again!"
Dream,"This might be Dream&#39;s biggest L yet, losing not only the match, but because of a dolphin attack, which he was completely unprepared for. And also, Bad definitely pulled a lot of clutches, especially with the beds."
Dream,All I&#39;ve learned from this video is that Bad is a surprisingly good escape artist.
Dream,"BBH: &quot;You&#39;ve saved me!&quot;<br><br>Dream/George/Sapnap: &quot;Oh, I wouldn&#39;t say &#39;saved&#39;. More like... under new management.&quot;"
Dream,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GSc0ldz4TE&amp;t=19m37s"">19:37</a> George&#39;s sarcasm is really funny here, loved it"
Dream,"I feel like this concept could use some refining. The two capture teams should probably have different objectives to achieve with the hostage, and there should also be an actual win condition for the hostage, since it didn&#39;t actually seem like Bad had a way to win since there were no time limits or death limits for the hunters."
Dream,"george and dream jumping in front of each other for a few seconds, shields up expecting the other to attack, while Bad has some time to run away was a very silly moment in an otherwise dramatic moment."
Dream,"I know it was only for a minute, but I need way more of Bad and Dream being a team!!"
Dream,"The irony of Dream knowing all these tricks and hacks, but not that dolphins are neutral till attacked is hilarious!"
Dream,"George and Sapnap struggling to have sanity with Bad in the nether, but then there&#39;s calm, collected Dream who puts on parent mode to gain some obedience from the child! 🤣🤣<br><br>LIterally the scene in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GSc0ldz4TE&amp;t=25m28s"">25:28</a>. Best parenthood I&#39;ve seen in a long time. Dream doesn&#39;t play."
Dream,"It would be so fun to watch Sam being the hostage too with his Redstone knowledge or Ant, we&#39;ve seen how smart he is lol."
Dream,"Imagine dream being the hostage. It becomes a full manhunt itself, plus the fact that he is invincible too!"
Dream,"Anyone notice the new captions on this vid? They&#39;re even colored and labeled depending on the person, they&#39;re really useful for making out everyone&#39;s words in the chaos! <br>Also they revealed some funny moments lol,<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GSc0ldz4TE&amp;t=2m03s"">2:03</a> There&#39;s a tilde at the end of Bad&#39;s &quot;I&#39;ve been a bad boy&quot; which is uh... yeah...<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GSc0ldz4TE&amp;t=4m45s"">4:45</a> Creeper aw man<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GSc0ldz4TE&amp;t=6m53s"">6:53</a> Bad is hostagephobic.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GSc0ldz4TE&amp;t=7m12s"">7:12</a> George&#39;s &quot;witteraly&quot; is spelled that way lol.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GSc0ldz4TE&amp;t=10m57s"">10:57</a> &quot;You shall not pass!&quot; (he will)<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GSc0ldz4TE&amp;t=13m08s"">13:08</a> Adverse consequences.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GSc0ldz4TE&amp;t=16m13s"">16:13</a> Bad&#39;s a menace in the bed.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GSc0ldz4TE&amp;t=20m22s"">20:22</a> Sapnap wants revenge.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GSc0ldz4TE&amp;t=23m02s"">23:02</a> Bad screaming that he&#39;s free in the bg. xD<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GSc0ldz4TE&amp;t=25m04s"">25:04</a> &quot;It was a valiant effort.&quot;<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GSc0ldz4TE&amp;t=27m25s"">27:25</a> Sapnap belch.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GSc0ldz4TE&amp;t=28m20s"">28:20</a> Sapnap gibberish."
Dream,"Love bads hostage arc. He goes from passively asking to be let go to learning to burn fences and creating bombs. Then he learns the art of negotiation. Finally, he just teams with the kidnappers."
Dream,"Maybe the hostage can win by lasting a certain amount of time and not being taken to the end. Like maybe their goal is to last two or three hours depending on how long this took, and if he’s not taken to the end by then, he wins. It would add more incentive for Bad to find ways to escape"
Dream,"This is a funny twist on the usual types of videos, I love Bad being such a menace and them having to tie him to posts and block him in and then he STILL escapes from them😂and I loved to see Dream and Bad teaming up occasionally too, as well as that lava bucket clutch, very cool! Seeing bad dangle off the cliff by George and then dangling off the nether&#39;s ceiling like that is hilarious 😂😂"
Dream,"I like how Dream sounds the same even without a voice changer.<br><br>Edit from 5 days later: whenever I put on captions it puts everyone’s names and different colors, YouTube algorithm is getting better"
Dream,"Watching from the Philippines, so glad you mentioned our country and you were the one who inspired me to play minecraft, thank you for everything you have done for us viewers... Just keep being positive!"
Dream,Love how dream and sapnap/george became so united in their utter annoyance towards BBh
Dream,"This went from &quot;Badboyhalo in a custody battle&quot; to Bad going full Rorschach &quot;I&#39;m not locked in here with you, you&#39;re locked in here with me!&quot; real quick, and I love it."
Dream,"I think this mod would be interesting if Dream had to speedrun while trying to get all three of them in the portal, but they also try doing what bad was doing the whole time"
Dream,I love how bad is behaving like a bad behaved 4 year old kid and dream is like the parent who has to deal with it somehow 😂
Dream,bbh getting more and more agressive and the pain in their ass lmao
Dream,I love how both of the parties team up and agree when dream hangs bad to the ceiling from the nether
Dream,"This is such a good format, it&#39;s like taking a screaming toddler somewhere they don&#39;t want to be, so you have to plead, resort to bribery, pull off insane clutches. Would love to see more of it!"
Dream,The stress bringing the hostage to the end felt more personal than the stress to fight other hunters 😂
Dream,I&#39;d like to see dream as the hostage if this makes a return tbh
Dream,Would love to see more of this type of videos. Thank you Dream :)
Dream,Nice to see bad finally living up to his name
Dream,Dream&#39;s intense negotiation with Bad had me rolling bro
Dream,"Bad in this video is just a neutral source of chaos. No matter which side he&#39;s with, he causes them trouble lmao"
Dream,It&#39;s so funny how they all keep asking Bad to give them stuff 😂
Dream,I really loved this video. It would be so funny to do one with the hunters trying to catch Dream and take him to the End &lt;3
Dream,Love how by the end of the vid everyone just has a mutual profound annoyance with Bad 😂
Dream,spoiler alert: dream dies again
Dream,honestly amazing how dream has gone from “can you even beat the game without enchants?” to setting the speed run world record
Dream,I can’t believe this guy later broke the speedrunning world record 3 times.
Dream,Dream : Beat minecraft many times with hunters who want to kill him<br>Also Dream : Die by a flower
Dream,Dream: You know what.. I&#39;m getting inside you.<br>George: I don&#39;t appreciate that terminology..
Dream,"As a Californian, I can confirm that the bear dream is referring to is “Smokey the Bear” 🐻"
Dream,“Respect women.” <br><br><b>proceeds to kill the only confirmed female thing in the game</b>
Dream,Nobody:<br><br><br>Dream: puts out fires with lava buckets
Dream,dream and george: have infinite diamonds<br>also george: still has an iron pickaxe
Dream,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1K3aXv9f3w&amp;t=19m20s"">19:20</a><br>&quot;It&#39;s not guaranteed to drop a pearl, you could just risk it&quot; <br>Immediately flooded by pearls"
Dream,"&quot;Minecraft, but every time you jump a mob spawns near you&quot;<br>&quot;Minecraft, but its wholesome&quot;<br>&quot;Minecraft but when you look at a mob it multiplies in size&quot;<br>&quot;Minecraft but its triangles&quot;<br>&quot;Minecraft but every time you eat the mobs become stronger&quot;<br>&quot;Minecraft but its moomoo meadows, and the cows are evil&quot;<br>&quot;Minecraft but the textures are mixed&quot;<br>&quot;Minecraft but its realistic&quot;<br>&quot;Minecraft but the mobs are crazy&quot;<br>&quot;Minecraft but the crafting recipes are mixed up&quot;<br>&quot;Minecraft but every mob is disguised as a pig&quot;<br>edit: YOOOOOOOO WHYD THIS GET SO MANY LIKES thanks 😀👍🏻"
Dream,"Daaaang, coming back to these old videos in 2021 it feels weird hearing them say things like<br>&quot;Can we beat the game without enchanted armor?&quot;<br>&quot;I forgot you can&#39;t place water in the nether&quot;<br>&quot;If we get 30k likes on this video...&quot;<br>..."
Dream,"&quot;I&#39;m gonna die, I broke a flower.&quot;, Dream<br>That has never been said in the history of man"
Dream,dream then: &#39;I think we can beat the game with no enchants&#39;<br><br>dream today: beating easily with no armour
Dream,“Can we beat  without enchantments?”<br><br>I wonder how Dream looks back at that
Dream,Just George and Dream casually stacking diamond blocks
Dream,Dream went from: Can we beat the enderdragon without enchants?<br>To beating enderdragon with no armor at all and 3 other players chasing him
Dream,Dream: I&#39;ll cut it out<br>Reality: 0% chance it&#39;s not coming out
Dream,Dream: “OMG YOU CANT BREAK COAL ITS UNNECESSARY”<br><br>Also Dream: Breaks multiple stone and gravel blocks
Dream,"I love how in any other Minecraft series, the ender dragon fight would be an epic long video, but on dreams channel, it&#39;s a time lapse"
Dream,“I think we can beat the game without enchants.” Months later casually beating the game without any armor
Dream,"Dream at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1K3aXv9f3w&amp;t=8m33s"">8:33</a> :I have to kill the spider, I can&#39;t run.<br><br>Also Dream: <b>*basically has full hunger*</b>"
Dream,dream and george: towering around with diamond blocks<br><br>me: flashbacks to being 9 years old playing in creative mode
Dream,Dream: Casually burning a stack of diamonds
Dream,You know you’re flexing <b>hard</b> when you tower with <b>diamond blocks</b>
Dream,Nobody:<br>Dream: Just flexing by towering with diamond blocks
Dream,Imagine being as loaded as Dream and George to the point to where you can build up with diamond blocks
Dream,“I’m gonna die I’m gonna die I broke a flower!”<br>That’s one of the weirdest sentences I’ve ever heard
Dream,hearing dream talk about smokey the bear while calling it snoop dogg is so funny
Dream,Ok but we love how they are towering out of the cave with diamond blocks 😂
Dream,Dream: <b>trying to fight a spider</b><br><br>Flower: <b>I’m going to end this mans whole career</b>
Dream,"Next episode - &quot;Hey guys, we coded it so that if you die in the game, you die in real life.&quot;"
Dream,Dream: “I just burnt myself a little”.<br>Also Dream: <b>Is literally on fire.</b>
Dream,Can we just appreciate that dream chose “respect women” as his last words before George killed the dragon :)
Dream,Dream: a speedrunner<br>Also Dream: Hyped by a shield

Dream,"“We’re pros”<br>“Wait, how do you shield?”<br>-George 🤣"
Dream,Crazy to see how much dream has improved. He said &quot;do you think we need enchants to beat the game?&quot;
Dream,“I think we can beat the game without enchantments”<br>And now hes doing the world record with iron gear
Dream,Dream: I’m getting inside you<br>George: I don’t appreciate that terminology-

Dream,Alternative title:<br><b>Dream being George’s bodyguard for 19 minutes and 27 seconds</b>
Dream,looking back at this. dream can truly do this video himself now
Dream,2 years later and dream still hasn’t “gathered the components and video recorded “ himself doing this 😢
Dream,Can we just appreciate how much pain George has been through for us. Thanks for uploading videos like this.
Dream,Dream: Risks his life and protects George from almost all damage.<br>George: sToP lOoKiNg At Me I dOnT tRuSt YoU
Dream,Just imagine.<br>There are actual players out there that play exactly how George did in this video.<br>Without the shock irl.
Dream,"Dream protecting George all he can for 19 min straight, so he does not get shocked in pain"
Dream,"george: gets through the stronghold, fights a bunch of mobs and takes no damage<br>also george: <b>walks into berry bush</b>"
Dream,I love how every time George gets shocked he blames dream for it. 😂
Dream,"I’ve watched so many videos of him now and I’ve still never heard George speak the way he does in this video, he’s so genuine sacred 😭😂"
Dream,Dream: Says he doesn’t want George to get hurt.<br>Also Dream: Punches George to make sure it works.
Dream,I love how protective Dream is of George this entire video &lt;3
Dream,I love how George survived so long without being shocked but when Skeppy did this live he immediately got shocked 💀
Dream,"Shock #1: Malfunction at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA7AE-3yq7Y&amp;t=3m35s"">3:35</a><br>Shock #2: Dream hits george at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA7AE-3yq7Y&amp;t=9m28s"">9:28</a><br>Shock #3: Skeleton Bow at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA7AE-3yq7Y&amp;t=11m09s"">11:09</a><br>Shock #4: Enderman at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA7AE-3yq7Y&amp;t=11m25s"">11:25</a><br>Shock #5: Berry bush at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA7AE-3yq7Y&amp;t=16m24s"">16:24</a><br>Shock #6: Phantom (i think) at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA7AE-3yq7Y&amp;t=18m06s"">18:06</a><br>Shock #7: Phantom again at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA7AE-3yq7Y&amp;t=18m32s"">18:32</a><br>Shock #8: Phantom AGAIN at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA7AE-3yq7Y&amp;t=18m50s"">18:50</a><br>Final shock: Fall damage at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA7AE-3yq7Y&amp;t=18m57s"">18:57</a>"
Dream,"<b>Dream hits George</b> 5 min later, Dream: “I swear to god I don’t want you to get hurt”."
Dream,Alternative Title: George worrying about fire for 7 minutes straight
Dream,Things that died in the making of this video:<br>George’s arm<br>George’s throat<br>George’s sanity<br>Dream’s eardrums
Dream,"I miss these videos, just George and Dream vibing and joking around with eachother, and George screaming in fear throughout the video"
Dream,Dream basically doing all the hard work while George is scared.
Dream,"I wonder how painful the shock is. I mean, considering how afraid George was this entire video, I’m assuming that the shock would hurt a lot."
Dream,Dream: Trying to Protecting George.<br><br>George: Screaming at the top of his lungs.
Dream,"I remember watching this when it came out, since Dream did his face reveal hes gotta be the one to get shocked now lol"
Dream,George: Is scared he&#39;s gonna take damage especially from things like skeletons<br>Also George: Doesn&#39;t use a shield for protection from projectiles
Dream,Real title: Dream protecting George for 18 mins and 57 seconds not straight
Dream,I just love how George scream for Dream’s  help like Dream’s his husband 💀
Dream,I like the fact George is scared of taking damage even if there are no things near him to take damage on him.
Dream,A moment of silence for everyone who thought dream was George
Dream,"After Dream&#39;s face reveal, he should do the challenge on himself then. That&#39;s a challenge I guess everyone wants to see"
Dream,Alternative title: Dream treating George as his princess for 19 minutes straight<br> because he doesn&#39;t want him to suffer
Dream,dream protecting George is the most wholesome thing i have seen today hahah
Dream,I&#39;ve never seen George get so scared of mobs so funny...
Dream,basically dream being a tea kettle every time george is dying inside
Dream,"&#39;I swear the god I really don&#39;t want you to get hurt, My heart was raising as I was killing it&#39;<br>- Dream , To George"
Dream,I&#39;m gonna  need a remake of this video with Dream being the person being shocked now since he has made a face reveal.
Dream,"Alternate title: Minecraft, but George is Scared of Everything"
Dream,Dream making sure George doesn&#39;t gets shocked.<br>Meanwhile George laughs at dream for getting shocked <br>The difference...
Dream,I love how dream is so chill while george is being being bullied by phantoms
Dream,"Shock #1: Malfunction at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA7AE-3yq7Y&amp;t=3m35s"">3:35</a><br>Shock #2: Dream hits george at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA7AE-3yq7Y&amp;t=9m28s"">9:28</a><br>Shock #3: Skeleton Bow at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA7AE-3yq7Y&amp;t=11m09s"">11:09</a><br>Shock #4: Enderman at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA7AE-3yq7Y&amp;t=11m25s"">11:25</a><br>Shock #5: Berry bush at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA7AE-3yq7Y&amp;t=16m24s"">16:24</a><br>Final shock: Fall damage at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA7AE-3yq7Y&amp;t=18m57s"">18:57</a>"

Dream,Alt title: dream protecting george for 19 minutes and 29 seconds strait
Dream,Can’t wait to see dream getting shocked since sapnap and George can be there to witness it 😂
Dream,"Okay, but can we all appreciate the fact that this was like a parent trying to keep their child safe?<br><br>Like, imagine every time George called for Dream, he was actually saying &quot;MOM&quot;"
Dream,"now after the face reveal happened, dream really should do that, so George gets his revenge for all the test punshes 😂"
Dream,George just sounds like he&#39;s on the verge of tears the whole time.
Dream,So this is the guy that broke the speedrun world record
Dream,Dream: casually breaks bedrock and places it back with a iron pickaxe <br><br>Me: 👁👄👁
Dream,&quot;I heard there were coordinates or whatever they&#39;d be able to find it&quot;<br><br>Dream: <b>Shows Coordinates on screen</b>
Dream,Let’s just appreciate the fact that he broke the bedrock with a stone pickaxe.
Dream,"It’s funny how, even when he’s trying to act like a noob, he still jumps to run faster in the mine"
Dream,"It&#39;s incredible how good he is at acting. As someone who did a lot of theater, it&#39;s way harder than it looks not to laugh when doing what he&#39;s doing, but not only does he not laugh, he manages to keep his normal tone and a monotone voice like he&#39;s absolutely serious. This is genuinely impressive"
Dream,"Imagine a person who has never seen dream before, clicked this video and thought this was real."
Dream,The way he just casually kills both of his dogs and says nothing has me DYING
Dream,Can we just take a moment to appreciate that he is wearing wheat for leggings
Dream,"Dream: I love the fireplace, <b>lights it on wood</b> , it looks beautiful.<br><b>continues to burn down the house</b><br>Dream: That can warm you.<br>Yes, Dream, it will warm you."
Dream,This is the REAL reason why Dream&#39;s homeless on the SMP.
Dream,Dream:    collaborates with mr beast who does loads for charity<br><br>Also dream:    Eats steak in front of a cow
Dream,I love how he tries so hard to act like a noob but when he&#39;s trying to put out the forest fire he can&#39;t help but parkour and move around like a pro lmao
Dream,Dream: wears wheat for leggings<br>Also Dream: feeds leggings to sheep
Dream,i love how he tries to be bad but his skill shows in his perfect parkour and placing blocks midair in the trees
Dream,Dream: &quot;I couldn&#39;t find diamonds!&quot;<br>Also Dream: Passes diamonds <b>TWICE</b>
Dream,Everyone gangsta until dream mines wood with a pickaxe.
Dream,Dream&#39;s old videos on 2019 are so underrated. It&#39;s always good.
Dream,Him throwing away the glass is the most subtle yet the most hilarious thing I’ve ever seen.
Dream,Imagine if this guy beat the ender dragon with 4 of his friends chasing him
Dream,Everybody: you can&#39;t break bedrock<br>Old Dream: <b>breaks &#39;&#39;bedrock&#39;&#39; with pickaxe</b>
Dream,"i&#39;m new, and i&#39;ve recently just decided to watch ALL of dream&#39;s videos (like from his very first upload)- i did not expect him to be this funny! he&#39;s so amazing!!"
Dream,“I need glass”<br>“I need logs”<br><b>inventory is full</b><br><b>throws away glass</b>
Dream,"As an amateur redstoner, the redstone for the door made me feel the urge to kill like I never have"
Dream,"Everybody points out Dream&#39;s 200 IQ minecraft moves, but never talks about his 2,000 IQ comedy"
Dream,"I just found these cursed minecraft videos and, since I&#39;m deliberately watching them, I feel like I&#39;m murdering my brain cells."
Dream,So we just ignoring the fact that he just straight up wearing wheat as pants
Dream,"If he wasn&#39;t acting, this would be the man to build an entire portal out of Netherite blocks and thinks it will take him somewhere"
Dream,He is still moving like a speedrunner
Dream,It’s funny how nobody knew Dream is a god at Minecraft back then
Dream,He&#39;s so good at acting that I was feeling bad for him.
Dream,Dream: &quot;how did this happen?!&quot; <br>Also dream a few minutes ago: sets wood on fire
Dream,The most cursed part about this is the pre-1.13 textures.
Dream,I love how hes trying to murder the sheep with the shears 🤣
Dream,How is dream so good at triggering my Minecraft instincts. I- just my brain is hurting.
Dream,This is the reason why i love Dream.
Dream,I actually feel bad for him because he&#39;s so good at pretending like he&#39;s genuenely dumb oh my god
Dream,"Oh god that was so funny when Dream started lighting up his fireplace then that piece of wood lit up, it&#39;s like &#39;oh, something&#39;s going down&#39;"
Dream,Me: thinking Dream is an idiot because of the way he acts in this video.<br>Also me: realizing that I’m the idiot because this video is meant to be cursed.
Dream,Dream: <b>Lights fireplace</b><br>Dream: <b>Is shocked to see that it started a forest fire</b><br><br>Bro had to not laugh for 10 minutes straight.
Dream,I wonder how painful this must’ve been for Dream...
Dream,The funniest part of this to me for some reason is how he just spontaneously kills the wolves at separate times
Dream,"&quot;I can&#39;t find a SINGLR diamond!!&quot; <b>passes about 3 diamonds in the ravine</b> and he was wearing wheat as leggings!! I absolutely loved this, and I hope he makes more episodes as his modern self!"
Dream,Dream: Why does it always end on a negative note?<br><br>Me: This whole video is a negative note.
Dream,The worst thing about this is that he powered the pistons individually. I cannot get over that
Dream,Dude he&#39;s so good at acting bad at the game I had to double check  how many subs he had to know it was him
Dream,I am suprised that he knows redstone so well that he even pretends to be dumb at it
Dream,Plot twist: this is why Dream is acting crazy on his SMP....... this is his origin story
Dream,His acting is on point tho-
Dream,I like how Dream wears a wheat and feed iron leggings to the sheep

DanTDM,The thing that confuses me is........how did Sabrina fit that whole puzzle and a STADIUM  into her gym!?! Was it....psychicness?
DanTDM,watching this back and I have a chansey earlier then dan even tried to catch it! also I am going through the game catching everything with pokeballs for extra challenge
DanTDM,Dan:Lets pick ditto up<br>Ditto:&quot;Ditto&quot; turns into snorlax<br>Dan:A little help here<br>Dan:I guess this is why pokemon is also called pocket monsters
DanTDM,30 minutes school:<br>How long is this gonna take?!<br><br>10 Hour stream:<br>Is that it?!
DanTDM,"If Dan needed meltan to evolve that he needs 400 candies then, that means he needs to catch 134 meltans. To evlove. I didn&#39;t need a calculator to figure it out tho lmao. Meltan per catch = 3 candies"
DanTDM,i’m finally up to date with these streams 😂
DanTDM,well done dan!
DanTDM,nice catch dan. also could you play their simulator again? it was fun to watch :P
DanTDM,Reliving these memories so that when I get a switch and the game I know I don&#39;t screw the game up haha :)
DanTDM,Good job of catching meltan
DanTDM,"actually yes, i made my entei and suicune my buddy once and they both needed to 20 km to get a candy. its nuts!"
DanTDM,"The last gym leader is Giovanni and his type is ground, which is good for Grassy Boi to get some levels since you had him off for a little. His team is Dugtrio lvl 49, Nidoking lvl 49, Nidoqueen lvl 49 and Rhydon lvl 50. Hopefully this helps you and everyone else. Love You btw❤❤"
DanTDM,Dan: went through the same teleport twice.           Also dan: This is mental
DanTDM,Another great stream
DanTDM,Omg Meltan looks so amazing 😲
DanTDM,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ1nyPre5YI&amp;t=14m23s"">14:23</a> she knows now well done Dan"
DanTDM,Good job Dan!
DanTDM,Was I the only one who thought how cute it was when Jen is holding the pug!? I love it!
DanTDM,"Amazing live stream I’m sad I missed it, I’m not trying to complain but the ad’s I get on videos are very weird, Anyways good job Dan! I love your buds and have been a big fan for ages."
DanTDM,"Dan, my family&#39;s going through hard times right now. My dad has bi polar, and my mom and dad are arguing a lot. Whenever I watch you videos, I feel safe. I just want to thank you for helping me throughout hard times."
DanTDM,"im actually just realizing that if dr. trayaurus were a pokemon, hypno would be it."
DanTDM,Love ur vids!
DanTDM,Articuno would be really helpful for the eighth gym.
DanTDM,I love your videos!!!
DanTDM,Is it only me who wants Dan to make a full series on zelda breath of the wild
DanTDM,hi im now 9 and ive been watching you for 5 years... keep up the good work DAN! <br><br><br>im happy you got so many subs!!!
DanTDM,Also I believe that it doesn&#39;t matter who defeats the pokemon from a. Trainer ur whole party (referencing FNAF on accident lol) will get the same amount of XP but don&#39;t listen to the man who hasn&#39;t played let&#39;s go Pikachu in 3 years
DanTDM,I spend an unhealthy period of time watching Dan&#39;s vids
DanTDM,I have tonsillitis and all I’ve been doing is watching u and you’re making my day so much!!!
DanTDM,Chamander is found in route 3 but you need to catch 10 or more mankeys in a row to spawn it
DanTDM,has anyone here just caught an army of meltan to get a melmetal
DanTDM,Dan your videos are so amazing
DanTDM,Double iron bash is the move melmetal learns.
DanTDM,I&#39;m sick......*real sneeze* but that doesn&#39;t stop me from Waching this great series Dan
DanTDM,Melmetal&#39;s signature move is double iron bash
DanTDM,I watched the whole  video  and I never ate  a thing for the whole day.<br>And your awesome. And I liked too.  Keep making good vids dan! Have  fun playing pokemon lets  go  pikachu too! Stay cool . And keep  being awesome.
DanTDM,Meltan is a pure Steel Type.
DanTDM,i &lt;3 this game!
DanTDM,"I wonder, it says you need a level 45 pokemon to battle Sabrina, but her highest level pokemon is 44"
DanTDM,Dan... Your in a VR system. Don&#39;t freak out... But this Gengar is...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>DABING...
DanTDM,i think meltan should be called metalwire because he doesnt melt and he doesnt have a tan but he is a metal type and has a wire tail
DanTDM,"Man, seeing this now that i’m now all grown up gives me nostalgia. This was always my favorite thing to watch thanks Dan."
DanTDM,"The cut-scene at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVvXI47uV4s&amp;t=6m15s"">6:15</a> was perfectly timed with the jump before the cut"
DanTDM,"I think I know the problem with the portal, you need the modifier in the middle or sides because the corners don&#39;t count as part of the portal. I&#39;m not sure, but I think."
DanTDM,"you can go to lvl 50 in enchant tables<br>its very rare, you normally get a lvl 30"
DanTDM,You should always carry your famguide with you in all the episodes. That ways you can change between dimensions :)
DanTDM,You can click the question mark when looking at recipies to put a faint template of the recipe in your crafting table
DanTDM,He looks so amazing with the light behind him
DanTDM,"If u shift click the question mark on the recipe screen, all the materials from your inventory will go in the correct spot in the crafting table so u don&#39;t have to go back and forth looking at the item recipe
"
DanTDM,"You only have to put the bookshelves around the portal 2 high. Also, you can only go up to level 30 with enchantments unless you use a anvil to put more enchantments on. Hope that helped except for the fact that you posted this last year"
DanTDM,If you hit the question mark in the corner when you look up the recipe it will make a template on the crafting table I think 
DanTDM,You can go up to 50 if you surround the enchantment table with bookcases and keep putting the armor/tool in it several times :)
DanTDM,Loving this series
DanTDM,"Ah man, the nostalgia!"
DanTDM,"I think I know what the problem with the portal is: that  nether portal must be on frequency two, so try setting the both of the portals (the one in your house &amp; the one in the eternal frost) to frequency 3. hope I helped :)"
DanTDM,You can use a dialer to change one portal to any other portal as long as its on the same network and is properly set up with an advanced portal modifier 
DanTDM,Am I the only one who noticed that Dan&#39;s XP disappears in Eternal Frost but reappears when he&#39;s in the overworld? Strange ._.
DanTDM,You can go up to level 30 for enchants. Try putting the portal modifier in the middle. That may work.
DanTDM,"If you press the space key while going up a ladder,then you’ll go up The ladder quicker"
DanTDM,i spent the first two and a half minutes of this video laughing my head off
DanTDM,"Also, you&#39;ll get better enchantments if you put bookshelves in the front to, just leave a 1x2 space open for you to walk in."
DanTDM,Might I suggest you add the ruins mod? it adds so much more fun into the overworld.
DanTDM,U should unlock the ocoleot  familiar because it makes u run very fast and helps you travel like rana
DanTDM,Bookshelves only work 2 high and 1 away from the enchanting table with nothing between (A torch can stop particles and the effect) The 3rd layer won&#39;t add a level bonus.
DanTDM,How about you just switch the books at the same portal so you don&#39;t have to waste your items
DanTDM,when you climb up the ladder looking up when you get to the top the minecraft players neck must really hurt
DanTDM,Gotta love me some of your modded survival!
DanTDM,"If I were you, I would probably organize your portal area by placing the rectangular portals on the sides of your area out there. That way, there&#39;s more space for more portals, and it just looks nicer."
DanTDM,If you get five flint blocks place them than break them and keep on doing it <br>It&#39;s  faster: )
DanTDM,"Be careful with a nether portal in your house :o Sometimes, pigmen can wander
 through the portal and into the house. 
"
DanTDM,"Put a torch under the enchantment table and put the enchantment table on top by placing a random block next to the hole and putting the enchantment table on it , then breaking the random block :D"
DanTDM,I&#39;m watching in 2015! And I can&#39;t wait for episode 77! -:D feeling excited 
DanTDM,"As for the portals mod, you can build a dial device and have one portal to visit multiple. and the purple side of the modifier has to be facing the inside of the portal."
DanTDM,I believe you can go up to lvl 30 in enchanting and your problem for the portal enhancements is that the purple side has to be touching a portal &quot;block&quot; when the portal is lit
DanTDM,Did you try building the advanced portals the same way you built the Eternal Frost portal?
DanTDM,Place the portal modifier under where the portal goes and dye it. The flint and steel in the crafting recipe shows u where to place it. Then light it
DanTDM,Try dying both portals the same colour ( not purple though )
DanTDM,You should clone Stampy Cat!!
DanTDM,You could make the melon slices into melon blocks by putting 3x3 melon slices in the crafting bench. It will save up space
DanTDM,"From what I know, I think you can only go up to 30-35 XP leveling on the enchanting table"
DanTDM,I love the diamond dimensions he should make some new modded survival
DanTDM,"Dan, every single day I check your channel, just to see is there any videos of diamond dimensions, cause this is the best series I have ever seen:)"
DanTDM,theres a higher chance of getting flint using a  axe
DanTDM,THE NOSTALGIA
DanTDM,Level 30 is highest enchantment level. Also bookshelves should only be stacked to 2 high and all around it for maximum usage.
DanTDM,"Although this is late, the reason why the portal takes him to the nether could be because he built the portal block into the corner, and it was counted as a normal block. Because it is in the nether portal shape, it counted the portal block as a corner block and ignored it. But this is just a guess. :)"
DanTDM,Maybe you should have lite the portal with the flint and diamond instead of a flint and steel.
DanTDM,Maybe you&#39;re using the wrong stone? Try the cold ones for both portals.
DanTDM,U should add a bunch of bookshelves so there is a small house shape and there is a crack big enough for u like a door space
DanTDM,theres a mod that can allow you to enchant to level 250 :O
DanTDM,The portal modifier needs to face into the portal to work like a stargate.

DanTDM,I&#39;m already looking forward to the awesome stuff people will make using the bone meal feature of the bees for...
DanTDM,Thanks for the showcase Dan! I have more info now about bees in Minecraft and how to take their honey.
DanTDM,"I wasn&#39;t so sure about the bees, but I do LOVE them after playing with them for a while. It&#39;s a really great update, for sure. I just hope they finally add palm trees in 1.15 as well."
DanTDM,Raise awareness for the bees. Plant flowers. Save the bees.
DanTDM,"I’m loving your content lately, Dan! I’ve been watching you since you got Ellie. 🐕 Great job and keep up the great work! 💙"

DanTDM,Players: <b>We want Cave Update</b><br><br><br><br>Mojang: <b>Ho..hoho ho...that&#39;s a very weird way to say Bees</b>

DanTDM,The public: we want a cave update<br><br>Mojang: bees got it
DanTDM,"I am very curious about two things:<br><br>One: If you outrun bees into water, will they still attack you?<br>Two: Can the bees actually die after they sting you?"

DanTDM,"Me and my friends made a new Minecraft world. We knew about bees by watching your video and had an idea. We found a natural flower biome with a bee nest on a tree, and we didn’t build a house... We built benches, lanterns, fences and beds. That’s it. Now, we have a nice little bee sanctuary. I love Minecraft and I love you, Dan. Keep making videos! 🤗"
DanTDM,I guess we have to BEE more careful in Minecraft now.
DanTDM,"I think the bees should be the size of the babies by default, and when you breed them the two will fly to the nearest hive and then three will emerge, the same size. Since all those worker bees should be female, and bee larvae grow in the hive, it makes more sense 🤷🏼‍♂️<br><br>But I’m excited for these to come to bedrock, regardless!"
DanTDM,<b>Mojang has an obsession with big animals and angry armies...</b>

DanTDM,Dan: <b>*looks directly at baby bee*</b><br>Also Dan: It&#39;s so small I can&#39;t even see it!<br>Baby Bee: Am I a Joke to You?
DanTDM,Minecraft added bees to bring awareness to that bees are endangered and we should appreciate them more just so you know they didn’t just add it for nothing! 🤧✨💕

DanTDM,Now that they&#39;ve added bees in minecraft. I can&#39;t wait for that last bear to complete the trio!
DanTDM,As of watching this video I got a new kitten named Jemma. I just thought it was funny that that&#39;s also Dan&#39;s wife&#39;s name.

DanTDM,Remember the bee mod...<br><br><br><br><br><br>Now the nostalgia begins
DanTDM,"The reason why honey&#39;s really good is that it has very high saturation, so when you drink it it&#39;ll give you a decent amount of hunger replenished and that hunger will go down more slowly for a bit."
DanTDM,Such an informative video and fun as well ❤️
DanTDM,Dan: Doesn’t upload Minecraft hardcore<br><br>Everyone else: Wait that’s illegal
DanTDM,"I really enjoy this video, thank you for making it and please continue to keep up your great work."
DanTDM,Dan before bees : 😀 Hardcore is easy . Dan after bees : 😫 RUN AWAY !!!  I AM SORRY BEES
DanTDM,So we just gonna ignore how adorable these lil guys are?
DanTDM,"Is Minecraft aware that bees use nectar to make honey, and not pollen?  Sure, bees pollinate while collecting nectar (which makes them really important), but I don&#39;t think that Minecraft is showing that bees make honey with nectar.<br><br>Also, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aCEZ3zeAw0&amp;t=6m38s"">6:38</a><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t do anything,&quot; Dan, you stole their honey."

DanTDM,"Dan of you like your hair keep it! We will support you all the way! Although my opinion is different, it&#39;s you opinion! Nice evening everyone! ^_^"
DanTDM,"I started to watch this series from episode 1 a week ago, exactly a week ago. And now im here. I have literly watched alle 249 episodes within 7 days... Im a true fan! &lt;3 Keep up the good work Dan.. I love you! &lt;3"
DanTDM,"I think you should have more time with your family when it&#39;s christmas in the Diamond Dimensions. Maybe told your family to follow you along the episode, it will look like you and your family having fun."
DanTDM,if your using 1.7.10 i would add the floor powder mod its a really good one and easy for transportation to another place plus it would be a nice edition to your fire place.
DanTDM,I love this series. It helps me find new mods.
DanTDM,I love how Dan said &quot;I&#39;m excited to finish the x-mas things&quot; then smiled
DanTDM,I suggest you kill void chargers for a very good sword
DanTDM,"Also, stairs or a slab over the fireplace would look better in my opinion but everything looks great!"
DanTDM,"Dan, if you type in the search bar @christmas festivities or the name of any other mods then you can find everything super quickly, hope this helps xx"
DanTDM,That moment when Dan has done so many mod showcases that he can&#39;t remember if he&#39;s done a showcase of q certain mod lol
DanTDM,Dan you should try to get the cloud pet. It allows you to fly really fast without morphine. It also has the added bonus of being able to summon lightning
DanTDM,Keep up the good work DanTdm
DanTDM,Who else is looking forward to Christmas?
DanTDM,for the deco craft bench you don&#39;t have to make the special clay you can just put red/green or blue dye and it will work too ;)
DanTDM,"It&#39;s not just scrubbies and terrestrials that spawn during the Full Moon event. It&#39;s also night watchers, dark beasts, and skelloxes that spawn during a full moon."
DanTDM,"if you install Ex Nihilo it will let you break down cobble to gravel gravel to sand and sand to dust which you then soak in water and you can make your own clay, just thought i would mention this since decocraft takes a ton of clay."
DanTDM,"Dan, your vids are the best! Keep it updated, 😀"
DanTDM,i just love this series its AWESOME
DanTDM,Dan where did dr.Trayaurus go? I miss lab experiments...😢
DanTDM,Christmas! Santa! Decorating! Trees! Presents! Its all amazing!
DanTDM,"Dan, I think its best if you change your floor in your house into a stone slab instead of cobblestone.. =)"
DanTDM,❤️Loved this episode!
DanTDM,"Dan, if you write the name of the mod in the Not Enough Items- searchbar and put an @ in front, it might be easier. Just a little tip! ;)"
DanTDM,U might want to consider putting glass in the empty window in the unused room and free the villagers (again)
DanTDM,"Anyone know if the Diamond Dimensions will ever be up for download on TechnicPack? I&#39;m really hoping that they will be cuz I wanna play it really bad. Or if you know HOW to get it please tell me I&#39;ve wanted to play this for the longest time so again, if you know, please tell me."
DanTDM,"this series has been fun but I think its starting to drag out a little bit too long. 249 episodes! that is incredible. But, I think it would have been better if it had ended back at episode 112."
DanTDM,Dan if your family ask you if you want them to cook you something you have to kind of say yes by going to their options and pressing &#39;cook&#39;. Just so ya know.
DanTDM,you should label each of your chests by what should go in there
DanTDM,"Dan, you should really look into Applied Energistics.  Get an ME storage and then you can have all your stuff in one place instead of searching a million chests xD"
DanTDM,You can use the Cloud pets in the Double chest pet to fly if you have quartz
DanTDM,Dan looks better with brown hair if I&#39;m going tbh :p
DanTDM,I hope Dan does a Christmas Countdown like last year
DanTDM,Great Vid Dan. Keep up the good work. I love your hat.
DanTDM,"You should build a Christmas house, or a banner house! Because lately I&#39;ve seen a TON of banners, and I thought a Christmas house would be nice!!!!"
DanTDM,Another idea to get rid of the villagers is spawn lava everywhere and push them in if you don&#39;t punch them then they won&#39;t get mad I think
DanTDM,Dan: &quot;I don&#39;t know how to find candy canes though...&quot; <del>flies pass a candy house</del>
DanTDM,Alright everyone stop it. We know you don&#39;t like Dan&#39;s new hair but he likes it and he has his own life so you can&#39;t tell him to stop it
DanTDM,Get the mod extra utilities and make a ME system to organize all of your items it needs power and it costs a little bit of resources but it is worth the cost
DanTDM,You can find the Items Easier by clicking the NEI Subsets and moving your mouse over the Mods then clicking the mod your looking for
DanTDM,"Dan, if you would like to search a specific mod in to many items try the at symbol then the mod.<br>ex. Camping Mod"
DanTDM,Make a big Christmas tree in the middle of the village made from leaves and wood then use colored wool as ornaments. 😀
DanTDM,I personally prefer the furniture mod Christmas tree than decocraft as the furniture mod is all minecraft plus the tree in it looks amazing
DanTDM,you passed 7 gold nuggets inside chest :P
DanTDM,You should add applied energiestics to store all your stuff
DanTDM,Dan you really need to download applied energistics 2 so you can just go into the crafting terminal and just search what you want and get it. It&#39;s easy to do if you have the resources which you do. It&#39;s easy than looking through a whole bunch of chests
DanTDM,"Just break the cobblestone in front of the villagers and do the fun thing where u watch them tumble out :3<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23DanTheDiamondMinecartFromTheDiamondMinecartDimension"">#DanTheDiamondMinecartFromTheDiamondMinecartDimension</a>"
DanTDM,"Dan, I LOVE your videos do ya think you could make a Christmas countdown again? Thanks. BTW I LOVE YOUR HAIR"
DanTDM,Can you continue this series after 2 years?
DanTDM,plz make more diamond dimensions
DanTDM,Dan you should put the storage hoise next to your house to make it  easier to get your stuff.
DanTDM,Nice video Dan as always man keep up the good work :) :D
DanTDM,"You can find wizards around that lava area as well(there&#39;s one in the background with the dragon), you can only unlock them by killing them with melee combat though unlike the other characters :) The character has a special long range skill too so I hope you do unlock him or use him!"
DanTDM,"Damn, it’s been 7 years. This man was my childhood"
DanTDM,"Dan, 2 things. First, try using the bricks instead of terrain, it is more accurate and better at keeping things smooth. It will also make it much easier, instead of trying to build with the weird terrain tools. You can also use the last tool in the terrain tools to save a creation."
DanTDM,love the vids dan keep it up :) love it !
DanTDM,Please bring this back!!
DanTDM,never clicked with minecraft but I am loving lego worlds .. I see great things to come for this title .. Nice one Dan :)

DanTDM,Dan: &quot;I did get beaten by a pastry&quot;<br><br>I died! xD &lt;3
DanTDM,Another amazing video Dan! Thanks for inspiring everyone including me!
DanTDM,"Here are some tips, Dan: <br>Rocket Escape: Every ore is worth the same amount, 1 point.<br>Whack-a-Mob: If you jump, it helps. And the back mobs are worth more points.<br>Crazy Paint: The more you spread out your paint in small blotches, the less likely people are to overide your paint. If you have your paint in a giant blob people will cover it all up.<br><br>Hope this helps :D"
Youtuber,Comments
Ninja,"I loved your idea ninja, if it&#39;s not too much work, a community clip would be sick. Your reaction is why people watch, so maybe you could get someone with time to find the clip, and then you could commentate it."
Ninja,Haha I watched this on your stream when it happened! Literally got out of my chair and did a victory lap of my room! Epic clip man and great job with the channel!
Ninja,I miss Halo Reach so badly :(
Ninja,I&#39;ve done a shitload of backjumps but never a jetpack ninja backjump. That was pretty damn cool
Ninja,"game analysis is better than random clips imo either way still fun to watch
"
Ninja,Please keep on doing the clip of the day... Who cares if others do it
Ninja,I saw 2 jetpack ninja&#39;s back to back in the BETA lol... it&#39;s back when people thought you couldn&#39;t jump high enough to get a ninja without it
Ninja,It&#39;s the first mlg jetpack ninja I&#39;ve personally saw nice clip I like just your clips of the day
Ninja,"just played against him, he&#39;s quite good, but i was constantly spawnkilled
"
Ninja,That intro is hilarious i love this guy!! hahah no homo
Ninja,"I&#39;ve seen many of these. It&#39;s still good though, I assume it&#39;s rare in high skill MLG"
Ninja,"Honestly, I&#39;ve fallen victim to the jetpack ninja. The worst feeling ever. I&#39;m a noob"
Ninja,the intro was the clip of the day for me
Ninja,"Kampy has done this so much! Unless you mean in MLG playlist, then, yeah, never seen it."
Ninja,i would have liked to watch ninja do clip of the day
Ninja,"It may not have been the first but, because ninja is a ninja this is the first real jetpack ninja :D"
Ninja,bestman kinda did the jetpack ninja thing already and his had a spin but this clip was still cool lol 
Ninja,Rare in MLG but the normal jetpack ninja has been used since beta ;)
Ninja,"Do your next next clip of the day  as BANE voice   
&lt;3 Chaos"
Ninja,"i have had many jet pacl ninjas, but not in mlg nice clip ninja"
Ninja,I got a Jetpacking Ninja for the Jetpack Beatdown achievement on Penance. Kappa
Ninja,BMan was the first one to do a JetPack Ninja.
Ninja,i watch the intro 5 times before the actual clip of the day
Ninja,"Theres been 100s on jet pack ninjas :)

Still beast though"
Ninja,I have done a jetpack ninja just not without a radar.. And how did he know he was coming....?
Ninja,"It&#39;s a decent ninja but definitely not the first lmaoo even I got one on MLG countdown on guy chasing me hard while I was 1 shot, clipped and all for proof by date"
Ninja,&quot;NinjAnalysis&quot; should be the title of your new series.
Ninja,good to know that ninja pays attention to the comments :)
Ninja,@Ninja first thing you should do in Halo 4 is 1v1 one of the Sudds to get a great clip and make it your intro for Halo 4 vids
Ninja,DAT INTRO
Ninja,What a fair compromise!
Ninja,"WAY BETTER IDEA NINJA....SORRY IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO DO THE SINGLEHALOCLIPS THING...BUT YOUR NINJA, SO JUST DO YOU MAN..BRING ORIGINALITY AND IM SURE WE&#39;LL ALL LOVE IT"
Ninja,i got a huge jetpack ninja in paradiso when i didn&#39;t have any idea what i was doing
Ninja,Maybe you can also make your own top 5 clips or something of that sort. 
Ninja,That&#39;s not the thing... He will continue to keep doing clips of the day. Just not clips from other people.
Ninja,i have seen someone on my team do that not to long ago 
Ninja,it would be cool for you to do  Q&amp;A. Like yamimash does or something around those lines.
Ninja,Didn&#39;t Bestman get a jet pack ninja?
Ninja,Suddoth must feel violated after seeing that intro lol!
Ninja,"bestman had a jetpack ninja...still good tho
"
Ninja,That blue dude is scratching his head and saying &quot;what the f*** just happened?&quot;
Ninja,"there&#39;s a vid with a 360 or a 720 jet pack ninja , I think either best man did it or some random guy on YouTube had it"
Ninja,lmao jetpack ninjas since the beta bro
Ninja,lov that INTRO
Ninja,Bestman got one on countdown ctf;)
Ninja,"Thanks man, you&#39;re going to keep post your own clips of the day though right? :/"
Ninja,4 people got ashamed by ninja
Ninja,ninja listened!!!! smart guy :)
Ninja,"I got a jetpack 1080 ninja , but in social ;) "

Ninja,"If you ever wonder how good ninja is, slow down the video at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yYPe-nX8-c&amp;t=0m49s"">0:49</a> . He literally knew when the enemy would locate and shoot him, dodged the shot, and then proceeded to kill him. what a beast"
Ninja,Ninj we need more MW content. I’d rather watch you play this than anything else 🐐
Ninja,"More of this please, hella entertaining"
Ninja,"I like how we’ve been seeing ninjas hyper more recently. I think it’s because of daylight savings, we set our clocks back and ninja after dark comes sooner."

Ninja,"Do more modern warfare content. I am sure a lot of time you play this during sponsored stream/video only which I get, but do more COD content. I enjoy watching this more then fortnite right now"
Ninja,"Dude you and your dad on GGG (guys grocery games) was awesome, you on the security Segway and then blaming your dad for Guy Fieri firing y&#39;all. Lol that was great."
Ninja,"my man hit that joker laugh <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsdIoiuyxlo&amp;t=9m05s"">9:05</a> L<br>LMAOOO"

Ninja,Ninja Is Dam good Player as well.... Love You Ninja.....
Ninja,Loving cod vids
Ninja,This shows that when people don&#39;t have their over powered custom guns they aren&#39;t as good.
Ninja,After Dark Ninja = The BEST Ninja!
Ninja,More of this😋
Ninja,Ninja trying to eat in between matches is as entertaining as the vid.
Ninja,If you are reading this I hope you have a great day!❤️
Ninja,Love how there’s no Hub on 2v2s
Ninja,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsdIoiuyxlo&amp;t=9m05s"">9:05</a> the laugh tho XD"
Ninja,This might be the only game where ninja plays like an average player and not like a pro  but he’s definitely a bit better then avg but still
Ninja,Double tap the reload button to blow c4 up without having to use the switch animation
Ninja,everyone gangsta till ninja plays warzone and stream snipers come
Ninja,Personally I CANNOT watch fortnite love watching 2v2 tho bro keep up the grind 🔥
Ninja,Ninja 🐐♥️
Ninja,Win  2 solo matches without shield
Ninja,Poor ninja. Too bad he’s with mixer now. 😵
Ninja,Still waiting for the meme video of Ninja-senpai.
Ninja,So because Jarvis has a following and is famous he shouldn&#39;t have to be treated the same as other cheaters? 🧐
Ninja,much respect for the chat clear
Ninja,I thought it were those games with Tim against Cloakzy &amp; Symfuhny
Ninja,Swear he is good at every game he plays
Ninja,ninjas pretty good at this game
Ninja,ninja be like &quot; Everyone is try so hard to win!&quot;<br>He just trash at competitive 2v2 in MW
Ninja,"Lmao 😂  @ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsdIoiuyxlo&amp;t=10m33s"">10:33</a> is what I hate that map. That happens to me every time"
Ninja,"Looked as tho for a while, things had gotten rough for you man. Glad to see you&#39;re thriving and doing well. You always seemed like a solid guy and I hated that it was going downhill. Keep on keepin on homie 💯"
Ninja,It just feels so good watching him do all of those strategic moves
Ninja,Ninja never fails to impress
Ninja,Keep up the great content!
Ninja,ninja thank you so much for being able to make my days better with your video
Ninja,Starting to like how Ninja when he plays well is like he just started playing and still feels new and awesome. Usually he bothers me though lol
Ninja,"Ninja really rised from what happened. I&#39;m really impressed, thanks Ninja for providing this content ❤"
Ninja,"Great stream today, thank you for the 1 month membership!"
Ninja,"It’s been the end for years, it’s never going to end if you guys don’t stop playing it😂"
Ninja,"Sitting here, realizing I haven’t watched a Ninja video in 2+ years… haven’t played Fortnite. Had so much fun with it back in the day, crazy to think that was 2018"
Ninja,Ninja been slaying these games as usual light work 🐐💙
Ninja,New chapter feels fresh and great can’t wait to see more content
Ninja,Love seeing him in the zone smart player always 👌
Ninja,Lol ninjas face when he got shot towards the player 😂 sake thing happened to me lmao
Ninja,"Its not breaking it’s leveling the playing field , its much harder for one player to be so much better than everyone else"
Ninja,"That hurdle and fly has caught me out, once or twice at the top of towers lol I loved the music you used for this vid also. props 😎👍"
Ninja,"epic really forces us to forget chapter 1 &amp; chapter 4, this makes us all amazed with the results that have changed 100%"
Ninja,"i feel like this season is so loot dependent, like it feels like there are some things that seem broken until some other dude pulls up with something even more broken. there&#39;s just such a big disparity in how good each weapon is"
Ninja,you get better every second so cool when you shoot opponents with the red-eye while they&#39;re using their hammer
Ninja,The worst part about it is the lag
Ninja,"Ninja is definitely top 3 greatest Fortnite players of all time. Keep up the good work, Ninja"
Ninja,I want him to start playing regular battle Royale again lol
Ninja,This season is the best for sure… love it bro keep up the great work loving these vids 🤌
Ninja,looking good ninja! and healthy
Ninja,Let’s be honest players like ninja are the ones who broke this game
Ninja,Bros actually so entertaining he don’t even got to do nothing except upload <br><br>W ninja
Ninja,Game is so glitchy but love it still. Top vids mate!
Ninja,that literally just happened to me... i got teleported out of nowhere
Ninja,"ninja making fortnite look fun   makes me want to play, i havent properly played since c1 season 8/9"
Ninja,"This channel is inspiring, thanks for encouraging me to start my own channel!"
Ninja,Chapter 4 sure is doing great so far. But it&#39;s just the very beginning
Ninja,"Bro ninja I freaking love you, me and my friends wait to watch you everyday during class bro your living legend ! Please start being loud and obnoxious again dude that’s the Ninja we need"
Ninja,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKLY_vuilCI&amp;t=2m07s"">2:07</a> is the break point"
Ninja,Someone explain how you can do over 160 white damage and they don&#39;t die
Ninja,"imagine doing ninjas emote on ninja <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>"
Ninja,"This channel is inspiring, thanks for encouraging me to start my own channel"
Ninja,Chapter 4 is actually fun it’s the first time in ages I’m actually grinding fn
Ninja,Because of this chapter im back in fortnite after 2yrs :)
Ninja,Nice gameplay 👍🏻
Ninja,Gg bro. Always well edited &amp; played...
Ninja,A lot of positive vibes in the comments man love to see it
Ninja,"Loving the new chapter, I have no complaints other than the hammers"
Ninja,wow a year ago he looked like a drug addict and now he looks so much healthier. im glad to see Tyler is better
Ninja,Ninja: Out of ammo<br>Epic: &quot;Hold my bear&quot; (drags ninja to low health enemy)
Ninja,I wish the standard DMR functioned just like the Cobra DMR but with only 10 shots...<br><br>So kinda like the OG Infantry Rifle?
Ninja,Amazing season so far
Ninja,Staying in and playing Fortnite is the new getting hammered literally 😅
Ninja,Man flew like 70 meters🤣
Ninja,am i the only one that feels like the DMR was just fine a couple of seasons ago and now it feels different? not sure if it&#39;s worse or not but it just feels off to me
Ninja,You can hold the hammer jump ability you don’t have to press it at a specific time
Ninja,What&#39;s the worst item in season 3 in your opinion ?
Ninja,"The new grapple is more of like a land near the person and then slide into shooting them, whereas the spiderman was more land directly on them and start shooting.  The new grapple is still good, just different"
Ninja,In my opinion the grapple glove is good. Yes I have some flaws about it like I wish it had more then 30 charges maybe like 50 or something. I also wish you could shoot while using it instead of having to wait till you land to shoot. Other then that it&#39;s still good for mobility
Ninja,"I’m so glad your back to your old self, your vids are so much more funny now, love it, keep it up"
Ninja,The grapple glove is amazing for mobility it&#39;s just more balanced then the spider man gloves because you can&#39;t just drop directly onto someone and shoot them as you land . And if someone says they are bad for mobility it just sounds like they are bad at using the grapple glove and are blaming their failure on the item
Ninja,When you use it you have to slide every time you have to land so it doesn’t reset and if you use right click when swinging you pull yourself in like the baller and go faster just not using it correctly
Ninja,"Grummpy edits are so entertaining, takes your videos to the next level. You sir are the face of gaming, you inspire so many keep up the grind Tyler"
Ninja,"I think we all need to realize that because of the Spider-Man mythic, the grappler isn’t as incredible as it would be if we had never had the Spider-Man one, even though it is an incredible mobility item, it just doesn’t compare to the mythic."
Ninja,As I have said before &quot;Now this is content&quot; keep it up👌👍🏻
Ninja,"I think the worst item is the ripsaw launcher, I forgot what it’s called, but in my opinion it sucks especially because it’s easy to dodge and your not even ment to attack with it just gives you materials by going through walls and stuff."
Ninja,"Th grapple glove is awesome, just wish it had more ammo. And in my opinion, the buzz saw launcher is the worst item in the game"
Ninja,The grapple is good for builds because when I have cool-down I can box up and wait but no builds I would use two shockwaves over 30 charges
Ninja,"In my opinion it the two shot, it’s like a primal shotgun but the fire rate is slower, shoots 2 vs 3 shots at once, has a smaller magazine (both have four burst), and slightly better range."
Ninja,I think the worst is a tie between the two shot shotgun or buzzsaw launcher.
Ninja,"My biggest issue is that I’ve noticed that I don’t even need to get shot for the thing to let go of the line I’ve been just shot at and it kills the hook and I’ll fall, it’s fun for the movement but I’ll be staying with shocks only really grapple if I can’t find shocks"
Ninja,The grappler is basically better than the spider man gloves in every way it felt awkward to swing with the spider man and it was clunky and you got yourself stuck behind walls way too much in my opinion the grappler is better in “ almost “ every way.
Ninja,I personally like the grapple bc I can shoot mid air using it idk why it don’t let you tho
Ninja,Que grande ninja saludos de argentina
Ninja,FINALLY…. NINJA IS BACK IN HIS STUDIO!
Ninja,"definitely not the worst item,   i grab one in the first minute of every single game and always make sure i carry,   land in front of them, and slide, they cant hit you and you destroy them,   never, i repeat, never land right in front of them"
Ninja,I really wish the grapple thing had more ammo but it is good but the worst weapon I think is ripsaw
Ninja,The meme type edits are hitting like a mack truck I&#39;m loving it. Shit have me crying laughing sometimes..and bring the G.O.A.T. at Fortnite and being a cool person definitely helps the videos too
Ninja,"“If it ain’t broke, take it away for a while and bring it back but way less fun” - everyone who works on Fortnite"
Ninja,I think the 2 shot shotgun is becuase poeple can just spam you with it while your using it and takes to long to pump and reload
Ninja,Thank you for at least trying to use the grapple!
Ninja,I liked your content so much at the latest days 🔥
Ninja,OK first off the grapple cannot be trash because there are some things we need to understand about it. Like for one if you’re using it a lot you need to make sure your time is it right if you don’t use it in the next say three seconds then it’ll just go from recharge mode it’ll take about 15 seconds to recharge
Ninja,"Bro I literally just came home and I got a notification on my phone that Ninja posted a new video, I’m literally so happy I got it because now I have the motivation to actually be productive and do something good for once. Love ur vids Ninja &lt;3."
Ninja,the grappler is def gonna need a buff before i start using it over shockwaves
Ninja,Sick editing this is 🤙
Ninja,The grapple glove is good but it needs more ammo and less overtime for the glove so I would be like the spider man gloves
Ninja,Bro I haven&#39;t watched you in ages glad to be back keep up the work
Ninja,“Worst item in Fortnite” I’d say it’s better than the firecrackers and boom box lmao. But I do see where he’s coming from this is a very nerfed version of the spidys and that have such limited shots as well
Ninja,"It’s a good item, it’s just not the Spider Man mythics."
Ninja,My list of hated things: two shot shotgun saw riplancher
Ninja,"i think the worst item is the ripsaw launcher and the mythic darth vaders lightsaber because they just suck id pick the E11 blaster over them but i think the grapple glove is good for getting away, getting high ground, getting into a tree to hide like a bot (like me) and getting to bushes (LIKE ME)"
Ninja,"The pigs and wolves are the worst, those things are soo annoying getting attacked by them mid fight"
Ninja,"grapple glove the worst item in fortnite history?,i think we all know its the brutes or infinity blade.(before it was buffed)"
Ninja,I remember when this man was on top of the world
Ninja,Are we not gonna talk about how Ninja looks like an Umpa Loompa in the thumbnail
Ninja,"I’m goated with the new grapple idk, shits fire. Only bad thing is you can’t swing up really high like with spidey to get into like trees or the tops of build battles"
Ninja,i once shockwaved myself into a tree and i fell off and then died to fall dmg
Ninja,"Personally I’m in love with them, I know that’s odd to say, but for some odd reason I do so good with them, so understand your troubles tho, it gets annoying."
Ninja,The grapple glove is not bad is a matter of a fact the best load out is a striker pump a smg a grapple glove and a chugg cannon
Ninja,Ok the worst weapon in fortnite is the ripsaw launcher 145% no doubt about it
Ninja,New editor? This was a really fun styled video!
Ninja,Best item in season 3 is a among us backpack🤣
Ninja,I can’t stand auto shotgun spammers they’re the worst THE SMG’s just don’t compare this is the same reason they removed the drum shotgun and the tactical shotgun
Ninja,ninga still out there making bangers
Ninja,Love the intro 👌
Ninja,Look at him holding in the excitement 😂
Ninja,"Ninja was frustrated with Platinum II, you can see it in his eyes 😂"
Ninja,Love that we can compare skill level now
Ninja,back then where there were not much sweats he wouldve been easily unreal
Ninja,"All the pros are getting Platinum two, I swear."
Ninja,You guys simply kicked ass😁
Ninja,He thought he was getting a automatic insane pass lol
Ninja,Good job ninja
Ninja,Bro got unreal #87 in four hours
Ninja,Nice shot
Ninja,🐐💙
Ninja,saw that live 🔥
Ninja,You want no. 1 Position in Unreal.
Ninja,let&#39;s go man good job
Ninja,Low-key think this rank system is based on your account level
Ninja,I lost in the beginning and got gold II 😂😂
Ninja,Nice shot 😮
Ninja,it&#39;s catering and babysitting at this point
Ninja,Me and my squad got 37 kills and then we were ranked gold 3. How is this possible?😂
Ninja,I got plat 1 and i lost my matches 😂
Ninja,I legit thought that that was gonna be bronze 2
Ninja,I got a 17 kill win in my first ranked game and it put me in bronze 2 🙃
Ninja,I love you so much❤❤❤❤❤<br><br>edit thanks for 100 likes @JoFlipper
Ninja,you are the best player and youtuber contunue
Ninja,Remember when Ninja was considered the goat
Ninja,❤❤
Ninja,He looks unimpressed
Ninja,Imagine not using your icon skin
Ninja,Why is his mouth not moving when he said “20 Kills!” 💀💀
Ninja,Lol that was the same one i had xD
Ninja,How many games do you have to do to get ranked ? 1 game only ?
Ninja,"150 views, wow"
Ninja,Gold 1 is pretty good for my skill level
Ninja,The next arc
Ninja,How did you rank up so fast💀💀💀
Ninja,I played first match Ianded on gun but some dude took it faster and now I need rank from silver 1💀💀
Ninja,That looks like valorant fr
Ninja,Gratz m8😊
Ninja,I made it to gold 2 on first try😂😅
Ninja,Only platinum 2 I was expecting him to get diamond off the bat
Ninja,MLG 50 is the only rank that matters
Ninja,GG
Ninja,and tehn chica gets plat 1 by dying first
Ninja,I got plat also😂
Ninja,i dropped a 17 kill crown win and only got silver 2 bro what
Ninja,i was expecting bronze 1 but platinum is alr
Ninja,I got killed right after i landed and now im bronze 3 😢
Ninja,Bro i dont know how they do the rank mode. Because in my first game i kill one guy and i do top 32 and i am gold 2😂😂😂.
Ninja,"I performed horrible on my first game and got plat 1, but he gets a 20 kill win and gets plat 2??"
Ninja,You’re the perfect example of someone who believed in themselves and grinded hard till you made it. God bless you sir
Ninja,"I stream your cast (and occasionally sub) not because you&#39;re a halo player, but because of your awesome personality and that competitiveness you bring to the games you play.

Would I, as a viewer, love you to keep playing Halo? Absolutely! I love Halo.

Am I going to stop streaming your cast because you&#39;re playing a different game? Not a chance in hell. :)

Do what you need to do man, you&#39;ve still got a viewer in me. "
Ninja,Do you guys think more competitive halo clans will bring the community back together? Just Wondering
Ninja,"Fucking go for it Tyler! You&#39;re a competitor, and if a particular game can&#39;t deliver for you, then you can&#39;t just go down with it. Hopefully Halo 5 will revive the multiplayer when it comes out, and no doubt if that happens then you&#39;ll play it. Personally I think it will be great to see you grow and kick ass in CoD. Do it man! "
Ninja,I totally support this move by the way. Gaming as a career means you need to go to where you can actually make money.
Ninja,"Dude! I&#39;m all for this, go where you need to! You&#39;re entertaining at the least!"
Ninja,"I think it would be cool if more Halo players gave competing in CoD a shot.  I think if you guys started logging in 20+ hours of Blops 2 a week before its release a handful could become and maintain a decent status.  It will be hard to be a regular top 8 team, but anythings possible."
Ninja,"Very interesting commentary Ninja.  Your reasons are entirely legitimate.  A career is rarely defined by staying in the one job for a lifetime with changing interests, desires and goals.  I&#39;m interested in the journey you are on and wish you success.

I know most tournaments are single game or console but in theory COD Ghosts, BF4, Killzone Shadowfall, Destiny and Halo 5 could be bundled into a defining FPS event."
Ninja,"Your ideology is golden for how the first impression of halo 4 should of turned out. They had great numbers in their first week, so hopefully they will be able to turn around the community with Halo 5. Until then I don&#39;t blame you. Plus, you being a pro halo player, I think you&#39;ll do awesome due you have that halo experience, and in my opinion takes more skill."
Ninja,Props to you bro for going for COD. I know Halo doesn&#39;t challenge me so I know it wouldn&#39;t challenge you. Hope you go big in cod! And don&#39;t care if ppl give you hate for going to COD.. people like that are ignorant anyways :P cheers
Ninja,"Ninjalicious wish you well in whatever you do.  Always great videos and everything feels legit and heart felt.  Personally I don&#39;t understand the love for COD and the first one to shoot wins concept. Always enjoyed halo gameplay, in game movement and the challenge of dropping shields with team play.  Peace"
Ninja,"Good décision ninja, money and media coverage is on CoD right now, and being a competitor you made the right decision, wish you the best, I think you can be one of the best out there in CoD."
Ninja,"You seem like a really likeable person, and it&#39;s cool that you love Halo and Halo 4!
I hope you can find success in CoD and whatever you choose to do, and hopefully we&#39;ll see Halo make a huge comeback at some point. It&#39;s my favorite game series and I have so many memories from it that &#39;d hate to see it fade away."
Ninja,"This is sad, but at the same time extremely understandable.
You&#39;ve given us all amazing Halo content over a long time, which we all appreciate tons!
So good luck on your future endeavors in the CoD scene and I will for sure keep tuning in! :)"
Ninja,Its a different type of skill. Halo is much more fast pace and teamwork depending. You usually don&#39;t have teamwork in RTSs. Halo is also much more about getting in other peoples heads and keeping a cool mind yourself. On the other hand RTSs skill is more about strategy and setup.
Ninja,"I did the same thing, I was loving Halo but then Halo 4 came out and it stunk in my opinion which I was hoping it didn&#39;t. So I switched back to competitive Cod and as you said as well looking forward to Destiny and Titanfall on the Xbox One. Also hoping Halo 5 is better!!!"
Ninja,"I completely understand, take it from me, people don&#39;t like call of duty (I don&#39;t) and we know that but the people who do go insane about it and I feel like them watching you can actually help them and show that you are involved in even more then just halo that you can be good at a game that appeals to a completely different following. So in that, I tip my hat to you good sir."
Ninja,I totally agree man like i feel like the hit registration and hitscan are perfect! on h4 but thats 1 good thing out of like a 100 bad things sprint is annoying atleast in cod its not a big deal because well if your getting shot most times you don&#39;t stay alive in halo its stupid i want h5 to be good i have hopes but if i see loadouts sprint i know descope will be in but sprint better not be in or atleast the whole game is based around sprint
Ninja,"I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re enjoying COD and I see you doing seriously well in COD, just don&#39;t forget where you came from man. I&#39;ve been here since the early days of your stream and don&#39;t want you to get big then forget about your Halo fans. GLHF ^.^"
Ninja,"Do what you gotta do ty, popularity is where the moneys at with yt and twitch. 

still jump in and talk of halo/ etc though, i find it interesting. i would love to see you stay up to speed with the community, talk of halo 5 when possible. Thats what will keep me interested in streams/ videos."
Ninja,good to see you switching it up. For all the people hating if your making a living on gaming you gotta go where the money is. I think your making the right choice and you&#39;ll do great in cod ghosts
Ninja,"Ninja I&#39;m so happy for you and I&#39;m definitely behind you 100% going forward. I wish you the best and the Call of Duty community is lucky to have you. In all honesty I hope a lot of ex-Halo Pros come over to our community. I think it&#39;s awesome that both communities can come together and help grow console Esports. I really do hope that CoD can become as big as LoL or Dota, I know that&#39;s a long shot, but the better the players, the better personalities the more it will grow. "
Ninja,"I admire your drive Ninja. I&#39;ve been a Halo fan since the beginning and an MLG Halo fan since the reign of Str8Rippin in &#39;08. I loved your stream in Reach and aspired to be a pro in Reach. Once it was taken off MLG, I wasn&#39;t sure what to do so I went to the game that &quot;took it&#39;s spot,&quot; Starcraft. Now I&#39;m a high diamond terran looking to play something else. I enjoy it, but it is such a freaken hard game to be skilled in. 

Keep competing Ninja, I&#39;d love to see where CoD takes you!"
Ninja,I cant imagine anything that you make with CoD will beat the videos you made while on Zealot or Countdown playing the suds
Ninja,Thank you
Ninja,We support you no matter what you play Ninja.  We love you man.
Ninja,We love you Ninj. As a CoD player and a Halo player I respect your choice.
Ninja,Whos here 5 years later when ninja&#39;s a fortnite legend
Ninja,"You made the right decision. I&#39;ll be watching to see if you succeed in competitive CoD. To all the people who are butthurt about this news, he said in this video that he will still play Halo 3 for fun so just follow his stream to see when that happens."
Ninja,I startet to play halo because of you.  I trained hard because i wanted to be like you now i am playing halo really good. So to see my biggest idol leaving halo is hard for me. So it is the darkest day in history so i will take i silence minuit for an fallen HERO THANX FOR BEEING MY HERO
Ninja,I love watching you play halo 4! Man I loved Funny moments in reach those were the good days I don&#39;t really go on stream I
Ninja,I suffered through halo reach and just couldn&#39;t handle another bad halo game.. so now i basically just play lol gta v and halo 3 from time to time. Just saying that I understand that its a career and I will support you through this Ninja. Watching ghosts prob isn&#39;t even as bad as halo 4
Ninja,Hey Tyler have you ever thought about playing with subs? I think itd be pretty cool if you just tweeted out that youd be playing in an open lobby and let your subs join.
Ninja,This is very mature of you. After your whinging against Holmbom this was unexpected. Fingers crossed for H5. I don&#39;t have much xbox time these days with my family. But there is most defiantly time to watch a classic halo experience.
Ninja,"A true competitor goes where the best compatition is, to keep his skills at their highest peak. Thats not halo anymore. A lot of pros as he mentions are switching; snakebite, formal, and enable. This is good for halo, because if and when halo comes back, the top pros will still have their competative edge. "
Ninja,"Ninja, ever since before Halo 4 when I found out about you, you&#39;ve by far been one of my all-time favorite Pros. I think you&#39;re a great competitor and you want that hardcore team experience. Calling out and teamwork, through and through. Halo 4 should&#39;ve been #1 on the MLG scene but it appears BO2 has taken its place - and for good reason. Halo 3 was the last good Halo in my opinion.

Good choice bro. You can only meet Halo half way, and that was too much for Halo. It killed itself."
Ninja,Its sad to see you go from halo (for the most part) but your still one of my favorite pro gamers and I think you have a lot to bring to cod from halo man good luck with it ill follow you no matter what
Ninja,"I&#39;m no pro but small tip... At around 4:20, you saw your team mate watching kitchen but you looked there anyway. You should have watched pillars so those 2 guys didn&#39;t come in and kill you and your partner. Anyway, I&#39;m a long time subscriber and will watch you in whatever game you play :)"
Ninja,"Tylor. You shouldn&#39;t feel the need to apologise. You&#39;ve given us (Halo fans) years of entertainment, yes you was born from Halo. But it&#39;s clear that Call Of Duty is the only FPS that can grow a player as well as a channel.

I wish you all the best in your Ghost endeavours. But remember bro, Spartans never die."
Ninja, I understand your decision to switch to COD but seeing halo go is so depressing. I have loved halo for so long and never thought it would end in the competitive scene. hopefully halo 5 will make halo great again. best of luck to you ninja.
Ninja,"had u ever thought about that during the time when u play halo reach u did a lot of 1 on 1 battles and it&#39;s quite funny, sometime u do incredible things out of no where which perhaps gets people&#39;s attention to watch"
Ninja,Look forward to seeing you compete in Ghosts!  Get some!
Ninja,"hopefully you can do what crimsix did and go pro in both. all the best, and i thinki can speak for all the halo community when i say make sure you use what ever means you have to get rankings, good maps and settings on launch on halo 5. all the best in cod"
Ninja,"always looked up to ninja as a H4 player but i guess stuff does not last forever good luck ninja hope to see you when H5 comes out 
"
Ninja,more power to ya bro take it all the way
Ninja,"Good luck Tyler. Im on board with you all the way. You and Nadshots are my idols

"
Ninja,"This was depressing to watch..<br>Seeing the halo community crumble with no one to help rebuild it over the years created issues in itself. Halo 4 was meant to be an amazing game that everyone would enjoy; most of my Cod friends were gonna transfer from cod to halo 4, but it wasnt  because it was uneven &amp; unfinished."
Ninja,"You&#39;re allowed to play whichever game you want, to me you&#39;re the face of halo 4 so it kind of gets me a little down but you&#39;ve done it respectfully and stated your intentions so I can&#39;t really get annoyed at you, just obviously annoyed at the situation. Wish you luck though."
Ninja,I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re playing/streaming cod an halo 3 since I like those games more then halo 4. an I obviously like your personality.
Ninja,i love halo 4 its sad to see it die how it did its not even a bad game...
Ninja,Keep it up and upload awesome videos like this
Youtuber,Comments
theRadBrad,Didn&#39;t expect for this video to do so well. Thanks to all of you who watched or are watching this short series! &lt;3
theRadBrad,"This series will be 9 parts total and finished by tomorrow. Thank you guys so much for 50k likes on this first part, I underestimated you! &lt;3"
theRadBrad,Got several parts of this going up today! Thanks for all your support. 
theRadBrad,Reason why I chose to stick with Brad is that he doesn&#39;t talk nonstop like others and chose to not to add webcam box to this masterpiece game thus not ruining the atmospheric tension.<br>Thank you Brad.
theRadBrad,"While this series was a short series, I appreciate your support on every part. If you missed me playing The Last of Us this past year here is the first part of it! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HawhjjF5qFc"">The Last of Us Gameplay Walkthrough Part 1 - Infected</a>"
theRadBrad,I want a dlc of what Joel done during the 20 years before he first met Ellie
theRadBrad,Just woke up and holy shit! Didn&#39;t expect this video to perform this well. Thank you so much for all the support so far. 20k Likes in just 6 hours is insane for me. &lt;3
theRadBrad,It&#39;s unreal that we are closing in on 50k likes in less than 24 hours. Much love to all of you.
theRadBrad,Last of us was one of the first games where I cared about the characters and had emotions towards them
theRadBrad,"This game does a very good job of giving the characters personality. I actually cared about what happened to the characters and the evolution of Ellie and Joel&#39;s father daughter-esque relationship. And when the game ended I actually kinda missed seeing the characters go through the story. The stealth system could have been better. But the story was by far one of my personal favorite stories in video games ever. When Joel&#39;s daughter got shot it almost brought me to tears, not many games can give me feels."
theRadBrad,This is why i love NaughtyDogs. They make their games like they&#39;re movies which is really entertaining.
theRadBrad,I just got done with The Last of Us and am starting this DLC.  Now we get a backstory on Ellie and also find out what she was doing when Joel was injured.  Loving this!!
theRadBrad,Here we go guys! Stayed up late as I possibly could for this one. If you want the entire series uploaded as fast as possible just drop a bomb on that like button.
theRadBrad,"By far the best game ever, plus my favorite walkthrough of yours! I love the suspense and everything! Love you brad  "
theRadBrad,"Brad says; It&#39;s a prequel, so those who haven&#39;t seeing the main story yet should be fine.<br><br>Game says; don&#39;t play this game until you&#39;ve finished the main story. "
theRadBrad,"Cool, looking forward to watching this series later tonight. I found your channel when an episode of The Last of Us appeared on the YouTube home page last year. I&#39;m not even a gamer, but I was utterly addicted to your &#39;Last of Us&#39; walkthrough videos. What a work of art that game was."
theRadBrad,"OMG I&#39;m so happy they added to the last of us. That was my favorite lp to watch Brad play, and I&#39;m so excited to watch this."
theRadBrad,"I just want to thank you for being so damn entertaining. I literally beat this game but I still sat at my computer to watch you play through it because you are just hilarious. Also thanks for playing all the horror games before everyone else because when I&#39;m nervous to beat a certain section, I watch you first and then play that section. &quot;Ex. In the last of us when you started the generator and ran up the stairs and turn the corner only to be killed by the bloater.. I knew not to do that :)"
theRadBrad,More on the way! Thanks for your support so far. 
theRadBrad,"Wow thank you so much for these videos Brad they really  make my day better, even though this game was posted in 2014 I&#39;m still watching it in 2019. Thank you Brad, your commentary is amazing."
theRadBrad,Been waiting forever for this DLC. Really shocked that it ties between both the prequel and the actual game. Keep it up man!
theRadBrad,"Amazing game, this is probably the best DLC ever! I so can&#39;t wait for The Last of Us 2! Good job Brad! Always love you talking throughout the game, very fun!"
theRadBrad,"I found your channel when I was browsing for Walking Dead walkthroughs. Stayed for the insanely entertaining videos. You&#39;re awesome, Brad! Mad love and respect! :D"
theRadBrad,brad you seriously make the best walkthrough&#39;s ever! i might not have been in your channel for a long time only since 2013 but i have seen a lot of your videos and there the best keep up with the good work!
theRadBrad,Part 2 and 3 are uploading now. We are halfway to 50k likes which is unreal in just 8 hours. :D
theRadBrad,"I found you last year with your Last of Us playthrough. To be honest, it&#39;s what inspired me to go out and buy the console and the game. I sold my old PS3 so I needed a new one, didn&#39;t want to miss out on experiencing it myself.<br>Keep up the awesome content Brad."
theRadBrad,"I found this channel when I was looking for a Last of Us (the original) walkthrough. I&#39;ve ended up watching Brad&#39;s entire walkthrough and now I find that there&#39;s this DLC I can play as well, now that I finally got a console. Thanks, Brad."
theRadBrad,I think I found your channel about 3 or 4 years ago and I&#39;m glad I did! You are hilarious and I hope you keep making videos so I laugh for 10 min a day like I have been! :) Thanks for making these vids Brad and I would have liked to subscribe earlier but when I was younger I didn&#39;t have a email and I couldn&#39;t even comment and I wish I could because there are so many great things I would have said and always would have liked!
theRadBrad,I have never been so excited to see more of a game...I love love love this game.
theRadBrad,I feel the way the cutscenes &amp; gameplay cut back and forth is very similar to how Halo ODST played out. It is also makes for a very unique gameplay that&#39;s story driven. Good job!
theRadBrad,Just found an Uncharted and Jak &amp; Daxter reference in this game! 
theRadBrad,Absolutely love this series!
theRadBrad,"been a while since ive been on your channel brad, nice one hitting 1 mill subs! looking forward to this LP. The Last of Us is the most amazing game ive ever played in terms of graphics, voice acting, gameplay, enjoyability etc and i havent had chance to play/watch this yet."
theRadBrad,the &quot;The Last of Us&quot; series has a special place in my veins because this was the first series that i watched on your channel.. hahah!! way to go brad!! keep it up mah maaannn!!
theRadBrad,"I&#39;m a recent subscriber and just wanted to say thank you for making this amazing walkthrough videos. You are super funny, keep it up! "
theRadBrad,I love the last of us because Its a heartbreaking never ending game.
theRadBrad,"i found this channel a long time ago, thanks for videos, i hope &quot;the last of us 2&quot; comes out soon love survival horror :]"
theRadBrad,"I just found the channel a week ago, which means I have your huge library or gameplay to entertain myself! You&#39;re a great gamer and this is a cool thing you&#39;re doing. Thanks for letting the story flow, that&#39;s why I like games! No skipping through cutscenes like a biggety bitch..."
theRadBrad,"I saw my first video of you because I was searching &quot;Game Endings&quot;. Then I forget which game I watched, but I was so hooked. Probably because your commentary is so humorous! I watched the whole walkthrough of Behind Two Souls, it was incredible! You are such a good commentator, almost too good for YouTube! Keep up the good work! :)"
theRadBrad,can&#39;t tell you how happy I am to see there is more &quot;the last of us&quot;. greatest video game ever! (in my opinion)
theRadBrad,Brad just wanna say keep up the good work favorite youtube right here ! I love how you let us listen to the dialogue and then speak to us your just all around the best man :) 
theRadBrad,"Excited to see this add-on to the original. In my humble opinion, The Last of Us is the BEST GAME EVER! Last year I was addicted to RadBrad&#39;s playing of it. I told people at work and at church. I obsessed on it. The writing, the graphics, the characters and the game-play with RadBrad&#39;s commentary -- perfection! (Okay, maybe not RadBrad&#39;s commentary.) Can hardly wait to watch this shorter series. The only bad thing about The Last of Us is it eventually has to end. Thanks, RadBrad for playing it and showing it to those of us who cannot afford to buy it.    "
theRadBrad,"I found your channel on this past Saturday, watched your enitre &quot;The Last of Us&quot; walkthrough and now I&#39;m here :D I like the way you play, and I enjoy your commentary.. keep it up!"
theRadBrad,Just finished a fat Last Of Us marathon I finished all 55 parts in 2 days and I&#39;m just starting on this now. I found your channel back when you did GTA 5 and I just want to say thanks brad for all the great stuff and keep it up!
theRadBrad,I&#39;m gonna watch this playlist a second time. Your awesome Brad! By the way. I found your channel when you did your Halo 4 walkthrough. Almost 2 years ago. Keep up the good work Brad!
theRadBrad,This was a great game last year great to see it back again Brad..
theRadBrad,Really enjoy your gameplays brad. keep `em coming :)
theRadBrad,"This DLC was so awesome, i really hope for much more in part 2 :D"
theRadBrad,I found your YouTube channel while looking for a walkthrough of The Last Of Us. I then realized that your videos were not serious walkthroughs but you were funny so I kept watching
theRadBrad,Of course this turns out to be a prequel! After I spent the last couple of days binge watching the whole series to catch up!
theRadBrad,"Oh my god, you are so much better and your commentary (and voice) are so much more bearable than basically everybody else doing a Let&#39;s Play w/commentary. &lt;3"
theRadBrad,"theRadBrad&#39;s walkthroughs are BY FAR the most entertaining I&#39;ve seen!
"
theRadBrad,I feel so stupid after the last puzzle because it was so simple that i couldn&#39;t figure it out on my own.
theRadBrad,Thanks for posting these.  I don&#39;t play portal because I suck at first person anything and the portals confuse me like crazy.  I just love the GlaDOS commentary so I live vicariously through these vids ^_^;
theRadBrad,&quot;after ALL THESE YEARS!&quot; glados is just epic
theRadBrad,"Most entertaining part yet lol, loved it."
theRadBrad,"From this video alone, I noticed how unneccesarily violent this game is. For Portal, in fact. Awesome. The explosions made me think that."
theRadBrad,"If you redirect a laser at the vent at <a href=""http://youtu.be/xrSuNDOTz3A?t=5m27s"">5:27</a> you will find a room with a group of singing turrets."
theRadBrad,"i LOVED this game, hope theres a third"
theRadBrad,is it me or is brad getting better? didnt he say he did the puzzles already
theRadBrad,The best part is GLaDOS humming &quot;For he&#39;s a jolly good fellow&quot; at 6:16
theRadBrad,"I like how Brad is actually pretty clever in terms of puzzle solving.
Some other commentators are painfully.... challenged"
theRadBrad,damn brad. you are making this an enjoyable spring break!
theRadBrad,what an cliffhanger :3 now i gotta see the next episode brads so good at cliffhangers :3
theRadBrad,"dang, radbrad has been uploading these vids like crazy the last few days he must love this game
"
theRadBrad,"To avoid turret bullets, you can pick up a cube and crouch to hide behind it. You can still move, but not shoot portals. Just if you wanted to know. Love you all."
theRadBrad,"Poor little turrets...their just trying to do their job! :( - Anyways, Im glad your not spending hours struggling through these, Ive really just wanted to see the story and how things turn out. And its nice to actually see the &quot;tests&quot; performed in a way people can learn by watching if they need help. So, I think you made the right choice by practicing before hand (via what I read in your earlier video&#39;s comments.)"
theRadBrad,"Someone have mentioned this already, but there&#39;s a secret tunnel at 6:53 that you didn&#39;t check out."
theRadBrad,I like these videos. They&#39;re a nice break from Amnesia
theRadBrad,"Man, i&#39;ve been playing WAY to much Half-Life 2 lately... Everytime you see a turret i&#39;m like &quot;Pick it up with your Grav Gun and throw it at another one!&quot;"
theRadBrad,"This game was made by valve team, when i saw it the first time i thought the portal gun was exactly like the gravity gun in half  life 2, and now the turrets, even the english accent robot looks like dog´s head, ah ah ah, funny as hell.
Nice work brad :)"
theRadBrad,"Brad,  When you upload a new video i always have a nerdgasm&lt;3"
theRadBrad,You can in the last testchamber go into the walls and see some interesting stuff. Did you know that?
theRadBrad,"nice commentary, great stuff"
theRadBrad,dude thank you for this video :D i was really stuck on the last part till watched it and seen wut u did lol. thanks man :)
theRadBrad,"Brad your amazing, ignore anyone saying this is bad! It&#39;s amazing. You plus Portal 2 = TAKE IT BITCH! Keep it up!"
theRadBrad,"@SQarmand 
At one time there were a bunch more, but I&#39;m pretty sure now she&#39;s the only one left, considering she was left in that one chamber for a couple years or so. (This is all a theory, but I&#39;m pretty sure the hotel room-looking chamber she&#39;s first in is a sustaining chamber where the subject can stay in a coma for however long needed)
In the &#39;extras&#39; portion of the game menu there&#39;s a comic that kinda explains what I mean. 
So, pretty much yeah I think she&#39;s alone."
theRadBrad,"i got stuck at the part with the turrets with the 4 cubes, i would&#39;ve never thought to do that!"
theRadBrad,I hate how in this one the Turrets arent like &quot;Its ok...no hard feelings...&quot; right before they die...
theRadBrad,You notice when the turrets shut down they things like &quot;I don&#39;t blame you&quot; or &quot;no hard feelings&quot;
theRadBrad,"Finally, a reason in Portal 2 for Brad to say &quot;Take it bitch!&quot;.
My world is now complete..."
theRadBrad,Who Else Was Singing For He&#39;s A Jolly Good Fellow When Glados Was Humming It.
theRadBrad,"when you killed the turrets with the cubes I feel dumb but creative, I used the boxes as a shield and no turrets were harmed. except the first couple xD"
theRadBrad,That part at 1:05 i just run threw getting shot at but i surived :D
theRadBrad,"&quot;Put me down!&quot;
...I never knew the turrets LIKED being killed!"
theRadBrad,"No, but there are monitors in the final third of the game that you can smash for a similar achievement"
theRadBrad,"GLaDOS: I bet you are ready to eat cake. Good thing that robot, Wheatly, was destroyed. [Went To Sleep]

Wheatly: Hey, lady, are you there? I &#39;m still trying to think of a way out of here. [Hid]

You: When will this test END?w
"
theRadBrad,"Thank you. although everytime I give up with the puzzle and watch your videos it makes me feel so stupid! I&#39;m like &quot;Of course THIS was the solution, what an idiot!&quot;"
theRadBrad,theRadBrad your so good at this game!
theRadBrad,"The turrets, to me, represent 10-year-olds on MW2, spamming dual G18&#39;s."
theRadBrad,Am I the only one who feels pity for the poor turrets?
theRadBrad,U r amazing for this video I think I am going 2 get this game now. Thanks 4 this I have liked your video and I will sub keep the vids coming
theRadBrad,Had this game for so long i stopped playing it coz of the last part.. i cant believe it was this simple...
theRadBrad,@theRadBrad If you do manage to get all three videos up i&#39;m favouring all of your portal playlist.
theRadBrad,The turret voices crack me up :)
theRadBrad,"I&#39;ve never played the first. I&#39;ve never heard of the game until they started to show commercials for part 2.. I&#39;m enjoying it so far. stuck on chapter four. Crappy surprise...
"
theRadBrad,The vids are great brad u belong on like g3tv or whatever the game channel is
theRadBrad,Brad you missed a secret room at 6:00 there was a turret in a vent you can explode and then go into the vent and listen to some nice turrets sing
theRadBrad,I&#39;ll love GLaDos:D she&#39;s have so much life:D
theRadBrad,"Almost 8 years later , the radbrad videos never get old"
theRadBrad,Still one of the most iconic walkthrough man it&#39;s crazy the walking dead finally aired it&#39;s last episode ❤️
theRadBrad,"When you get surrounded by zombies in this game, it doesn&#39;t get frustrating, but scary."
theRadBrad,I remember watching these walkthroughs and watching so carefully for the next video to drop. Brad thank you for so many great years of entertaining not just myself but a very large number of people. Much respect and love to ya.
theRadBrad,10 years ago came back for nostalgia and it never RadBrad never fails to produce! Keep it up my guy.
theRadBrad,One of the best gameplays Brad has ever done! 2021 and re-watching the series
theRadBrad,"9 years, and it&#39;s still one of his best playthroughs."
theRadBrad,"I just rewatch Brad&#39;s videos for fun, they never really get old, theres a bit of nostalgia when i do tho, Keep doing what your doing Brad!!"
theRadBrad,"This game is seriously underrated, its pretty cool to watch and frightening to play."
theRadBrad,"Thank you Brad for your diligence with your videos. Always entertaining 😉<br>This series seems to have really good voice acting and editing. Simply brilliant. I&#39;m watching in Seattle, WA👍<br>Best wishes to you and all ❤️<br>Stay safe everyone 🤘😎"
theRadBrad,This is just so amazing I’ve watched this series so many times and have beaten the game many times I just love it the memories
theRadBrad,"Im not sure why, but this game is extremely fun to me. I&#39;m usually into things like Halo, Battlefield, Forza, etc. But this is one of those games most people hate, and for some reason I love most of them."
theRadBrad,"this is very nostalgic for me, i loved this game so long ago and i still watch this over and over between periods of years and its still nice to watch."
theRadBrad,Ahhhhhhh the memories of me playing this in high school at my grandma&#39;s on the Wii U and hella junk food an shit good times!!! This game is so underrated deserves a revival or sequel imo
theRadBrad,"Oh my lord, this brings back SO MANY memories!"
theRadBrad,Played this game a dozen times. And still love watching him play this. 2018 anyone?
theRadBrad,"This game, with all its flaws. Still has some type of unique atmosphere. It&#39;s legitimate. Super lonely at times. Clunky yet appropriate. Highly recommend for any TWD fan."
theRadBrad,I know it&#39;s been 3 years since he posted this but when I heard RadBrad say &quot;if I get 10k likes...&quot;<br> I laughed. It&#39;s at 10 million views...<br>Keep up the great videos.
theRadBrad,"The fact that this is the series that I found Brad and I&#39;ve been here ever since ❤ keep it up, bud!"
theRadBrad,This might sound crazy but I actually love this game. It has legitimate replay value. Ive beaten it 3 times its just fun
theRadBrad,"Had to come back and watch this for for the damn near 4th time, this series had a hold on me and still does, I literally was sitting in my room when I started thinking about this game and his playthrough, much love 🤍"
theRadBrad,Re-watching this series in 2022. I&#39;ve played this game many a time and STILL Brad stresses me out while he&#39;s playing. Bravo!
theRadBrad,"My first Brad series, the memories on this one are lovely"
theRadBrad,"Little did brad know, that he is even right now playing as Norman Reedus with a feetus"
theRadBrad,"They need to make a game like this but with you get to play as multiple characters, possible co-op , and it has missions where it takes place in Alexandria and the prisons and all that"
theRadBrad,5 years almost and I still find it entertaining after rewatching the series every year.
theRadBrad,I love that Norman Reedus actually voiced his character in the game! 💓
theRadBrad,"This is the video of brads that ive ever watched and god its bringing back memories, keep up the good work brad from 8 years in the future"
theRadBrad,"I haven’t played this in years, it brings back memories"
theRadBrad,"I remember playing this game didn’t make it far in this level, but just now playing it and I’m a legend at it executing mad  zombies easily in groups"
theRadBrad,"I know it&#39;s late, but I actually had so much fun with this game"
theRadBrad,i like the dialogue in this game. Daryl really talks like Daryl. I wonder if this game is backwards compatible. It really does give me dead island vibes too. I wanna play it but i have an xbox one
theRadBrad,"I first started watching during his first dead rising gameplay, but survival instinct has been my favorite or even on par with his dead rising 3  playthrough. <br>I always come back every year to binge all the old walkthroughs, and I love Brad as an individual, and will always be my favorite gaming youtuber."
theRadBrad,"I really want to go back to 2012 and make a quality zombie game with Daryl&#39;s (melee, shooting) and Glenn&#39;s (stealth and parkour) storylines."
theRadBrad,I love this series and I feel old seeing this again. I loved this series! Yes I am a huge Walking Dead fan too! :)
theRadBrad,Its 6 years ago but still i like the story. Gonna add this in my watch list.
theRadBrad,The most underrated game of 2013. Idk why this game got so much hate.
theRadBrad,First youtube video I saw from Brad. Always remember watching his vids after I come home from school. It just felt like home. Thanks for making my childhood Brad
theRadBrad,Great video man your really funny and makes watching the game play fun. I Love TWD show can’t believe it’s been 13 yrs. It’s nostalgic at this point. Keep up the great work. Thank you. 😂😂😂😂
theRadBrad,"A next gen version of this with a 3rd person view too would be awesome! Great vid, made me want to go get a cheap 360 just for this ✌"
theRadBrad,The Walking Dead is also my fav show. I rewatch each season each year. Love it to pieces.
theRadBrad,"Wow, I think i have this game somewhere in my house. <br><br>I&#39;ve got so many twd games, but I remember watching this play through six years ago and holy- it&#39;s brought back memories."
theRadBrad,There should definitely be more zombie shows like the walking dead on tv
theRadBrad,I played this game so many years ago I forgot what it was even called so thank you for the memories :)
theRadBrad,I&#39;ve played this game. I&#39;m glad it gives us a bit of back story of Daryl Dixon and Merle Dixon.
theRadBrad,Underated game.. completed it twice before i realised you can choose different locations on the maps then played it though another 3 times
theRadBrad,2020 and this is still my favorite gameplay
theRadBrad,"The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct Gameplay Walkthrough Part 1 - Intro was the first video I saw from theRadBrad. I too am a The Walking Dead fan and this gameplay is so good. Lastly, this video is now 10 years old and I feel old."
theRadBrad,I started watching twd on netflix &amp; it&#39;s amazing . I never really taught it was cool . I was looking for a gameplay &amp; I found the rad brad . Your amazing rad brad keep it up . I liked the last of us gameplay you put . Keep it up man 
theRadBrad,I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been four years since I first watched this series XD I remember following along with this when it started and still love it to this day. To answer the question (albeit four years late) I&#39;m from Ireland. What about all of you? :D
theRadBrad,Looking forward to the new expansion later this month! Appreciate the love fam
theRadBrad,"This is such a good game, i played it myself and it gave me the chills! Love this game ❤️"
theRadBrad,"Wow, I can&#39;t believe it has been a year already. This game still looks amazing and the combat will forever be a favorite. Can&#39;t wait to see you play the new expansion."
theRadBrad,"it really is hard to believe that it&#39;s been over a year since this masterpiece came out wow, i absolutely love this game i would replay it from start to finish a second time,  and the fact that this game did not win Game of the Year is just what ??"
theRadBrad,Anyone else wants to see Brad&#39;s daughter play games like Brad. Thank you Brad for all of this.
theRadBrad,The graphics and the combat are insane in this game! Ghost of Tsushima is one of my all time favorites.
theRadBrad,"I literally started playing last month and I’m so in love with the game, all thanks to watching you play it Brad. Thank you for what you do man."
theRadBrad,A masterpiece to play as always. Thanks Brad for the video.
theRadBrad,Love this game. Your playthrough was so much fun and exciting! You made it feel so unique that I would love you to do more of this game. Hope you and your family are safe and well brad.
theRadBrad,This game never gets old it&#39;s actually crazy
theRadBrad,LOVED THIS GAME SO MUCH! Thank you for playing it again!
theRadBrad,it’s crazy how procrastinating works. I’ve been meaning to watch brad’s Ghost of Tsushima play through. I can’t believe I held it off for a whole year! Gonna go watch it now!
theRadBrad,Dang it’s already been a year since this masterpiece came out
theRadBrad,"Just had forgotten how insanely good this game was. From movement of the humans to animals. The navigation is my all time favourite of all games. Don&#39;t even need to say the sceneries. God damn, I wanna live in place like that"
theRadBrad,"Was literally watching Brad&#39;s first walkthrough from a year ago, I already played the game (which is amazing) but wanted to see someone else reacting to the whole story for the first time"
theRadBrad,Brad revisiting Tsushima on PS5 after an year is absolutely brilliant and refreshing❤️
theRadBrad,"Great game. Legends mode is very good aswell , the raids are tough but rewarding. Good community. Patiently waiting for directors cut."
theRadBrad,Love this game! So stoked to play the director’s cut!
theRadBrad,"Hi brad. Former subscriber from around 2012 , I hope you’re doing well , awesome to see your channel still thriving after almost a decade. Your play through of Prototype 2 randomly played in my head lol"
theRadBrad,One of the best games I’ve ever played. I have so much respect for this game
theRadBrad,"This game will never get old , exited about the director&#39;s cut"
theRadBrad,The game and it&#39;s story were just amazing and watching it here was the best brad
theRadBrad,Love this game SO much!! Thank you for revisiting it!<br>Please please please play the director&#39;s cut
theRadBrad,Hope all is well Brad awesome to see you playing this game again
theRadBrad,On the weekend I finally finished all side quests . Game is absolutely breathtaking. Can&#39;t wait for in I island expansion.
theRadBrad,"I loved this game so much I beat it in under a week, and then i almost got 100 percent completion but it was either a glitch or I somehow missed a quest really early on"
theRadBrad,Wow I definitely would have thought you have finished this masterpiece already!
theRadBrad,It&#39;s fun too see you play this game  again Brad. I still have never finished the game. I bought the game when it came out. But it is a great game too play.
theRadBrad,Had a blast playing Ghost of Tsushima. Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been a year already. Clear GOTY winner imho.
theRadBrad,"I feel as though you could might as well finish the rest of the &quot;main&quot; side stories (aka numbered missions) as the Dlc is leading up. To some of us the Tales of Masako, Ishikawa and Norio was just as good as the main story. And it gives you time to brush up on the combat and prepare for the iki dlc."
theRadBrad,"What a game, it&#39;s been 1 year old, I still remember when brad reacted at mongol soldier&#39;s ridiculous scream LoL"
theRadBrad,On my second play through new game+ it’s definitely worth it due to it being such a king story with a lot of missions and fights I hardly even temper the beginning stages lol love GOT 👌🏾🔥
theRadBrad,I just finished watching your whole ghost of Tsushima series in one week. I want more!!! 😭
theRadBrad,I had bought this game on accident and I’m glad I decided to just keep it because it ended up being one of my favorite games ever
theRadBrad,"1 yr damn time flies, I watched brad&#39;s walkthroughs of this game. Wonderful game and wonderful walkthroughs Brad."
theRadBrad,One of the best games I ever played. Beautiful graphics and storyline 🌊🔥
theRadBrad,Man... I forgot how good and aesthetically beautiful this game is.
theRadBrad,Damn can’t believe it’s already a year.
theRadBrad,Crazy how its already been a year since this cinematic masterpiece dropped by far best purchase i ever made on a game
theRadBrad,"Im excited for anything that you play! Ive been watching your gameplays for 10 years, i think youre the king of gameplays!"
theRadBrad,"My new favorite game ever,it&#39;s just to fun. I did all the side quests before I finished the game. I love everything about it. 👍🏽"
theRadBrad,I’m really looking forward to be playing the directors cut. The PS5 version is gonna look so insane with its fidelity feature. GOT is an absolute gorgeous game
theRadBrad,This is legit my favourite game of all time
theRadBrad,I just got done rewatching the original series you played last year. One of my favorite walkthroughs.
theRadBrad,This is so special to me cuz I just finished his original playthrough yesterday and I got the platinum last week !!! ❤️❤️👏👏
theRadBrad,Greatest game of all time. I’ve already bought the DLC
theRadBrad,"Tip: Water stance is good against every class except spearmen, for spearmen, you should use the wind stance"
theRadBrad,Always love these throwbacks 🔥
theRadBrad,I didn&#39;t realize just how much I miss this game. Give our love to the fam bro... :D
theRadBrad,Not sure if I’ll have a 3rd video up today for cyberpunk. Been spending time with my daughter today. Appreciate the support on this series so far fam!
theRadBrad,imagine spending an entire day with this V guy creating a plan on how to attack a base and agreeing on different ways to do it quietly and getting to know each others. But then when you put the plan into action this V guy just runs into the front gate and starts gunning everyone without even attempting to follow any of the plans.. and then says &quot;yeah plan didnt work out too well&quot;<br><br>Brad is golden
theRadBrad,I laughed so hard when Johnny yeeted himself off the side
theRadBrad,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgI5-0ggDw&amp;t=8m28s"">8:28</a> The cat&#39;s immediate response to Johnny&#39;s falling shows that it is no ordinary cat."
theRadBrad,Stealth:*exists*<br>Brad: this never existed for me
theRadBrad,Here comes brad making everyone&#39;s day better. Thanks brad!
theRadBrad,Can we all appreciate Brad going ham sandwich hold the mayo on this series while juggling personal life and raising a daughter? You&#39;re a rockstar Brad!
theRadBrad,&quot;If they see me. It&#39;s not like it matters&quot; Why do you think stealth exists?!!
theRadBrad,Such a mind spirited conversation between V and Takemura. Really liked this conversation between the two characters. Good characteristic values. Of the many conversations in the game this one has got to be one of the better ones. If only this game wasn&#39;t delivered to us unfinished. It would&#39;ve been easily one of the greatest games out there. Also CD Projekt must change the view when V sleeps it looks weird on how it&#39;s viewed as if V sleeps sideways with both fit out of the bed.
theRadBrad,"Yoo, the shootouts and quickhacking in this game is soo good. Keep it up, Brad!"
theRadBrad,I swear Brad’s character gets hit by a car almost every of his play-through’s 😂 I love his reactions lol
theRadBrad,I&#39;m loving your consistency and dedication to this game despite its bugs and issues. &lt;3 Much love
theRadBrad,I am loving this game despite the bugs. Its so addicting!!!
theRadBrad,Literally this is game is so good that you can watch it like a movie and it never gets boring
theRadBrad,Still here thanks for keeping it coming I&#39;m  really loving every minute of it would love to see you complete the game side missions and all
theRadBrad,I don&#39;t know if you know this already but you can do side missions after the main story but it&#39;s really worth doing them during the main story
theRadBrad,Stealth: exists<br><br>Brad: so i start blasting everything that came through the door...
theRadBrad,So did a little searching about &#39;overheating&#39; from the mission on with Panam at the cave etc. It is when a net runner is trying to hack into you. In other words &#39;short circuit&#39; you. You should invest 1 of the perks into &quot;reveal enemy net runner location&quot; in hacking so you can end the burning from the beginning if you want. Or pretty much increase you body perk?            - Someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong -
theRadBrad,Love this series!
theRadBrad,"Happy holidays to you and your family and many blessings as well. I&#39;m still a big fan of all your gameplay, I&#39;m just watching on my tv now instead of my phone. I&#39;m like a lot of your viewers, l look forward to watching your gameplays because I love the laughter you bring me. Thank you."
theRadBrad,"The agony of waiting for Cyberpunk 2077 videos, keep up the good work."
theRadBrad,"I suck at gaming, but your videos have been soooo much fun to watch!  I&#39;ve been binge watching some of the different playlist like netflix! hahaha Keep em coming 🙌🏾🙌🏾😂🔥🔥🔥"
theRadBrad,"I&#39;ve been addicted to watching this! I&#39;ve watched all of them, and watched AC: Valhalla waiting for this part."
theRadBrad,"I am playing this game every day at the moment, it is pretty decent and I love it, not gonna lie, but I still look forward to your gameplay videos with eager anticipation, great work as always ;)"
theRadBrad,"thanks Brad for the uploads...you  and a couple of other creators...are making this is experience good, despite the company dupping a lot people on the last gen consoles..."
theRadBrad,When Jonny rolled off the ledge the cat stood up and followed lol
theRadBrad,The music is so intense in this game and so good. It’s a shame you can’t have it on. The gameplay becomes so fun with it. You should play it on your own with the music Brad
theRadBrad,"&#39;&#39; i&#39;ll do the side missons soon, heard that they are really good &quot;. Heard this quote alot😂<br>I love u man. love what you are doing, keep it up❤️"
theRadBrad,After every 4 shots with the energy rifle brad relods it even in a bad situation and I&#39;m here being like there is no way this gun has only 4 bullets.
theRadBrad,I’m now getting the feeling that I’m going to watch this entire series and you’re not going to do any side missions. 🤣
theRadBrad,Brad: &quot;Imma do side missions soon&quot;<br>I think I just had an eargasm.....
theRadBrad,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgI5-0ggDw&amp;t=2m14s"">2:14</a> - Notice the cat on the wall talking with Takemua,  that&#39;s the neural image of the cat Johnny saw in the alley when he got shot. Then Johnny disappears over the edge and the cat follows. Great video Btw!"
theRadBrad,Just so you know you can&#39;t do any side missions after you&#39;re done the main story
theRadBrad,"@theradbrad for the terminals, you have to choose the codes by row and then column each time. So its a puzzle. So if its 55 E9 BD you have to pick the 55 that has the E9 in the same column, and then that E9 has to have the BD in its row. So it goes back and forth from choosing up and down then side to side. Also I havent heard you mention this but on the Playlist there are privates videos, are those something channel members have access to?"
theRadBrad,"Been refreshing constantly for the past few minutes for this,  Thanks for uploading Brad!"
theRadBrad,I love this series it’s so good
theRadBrad,Did anyone else not get the &quot;Jackie&#39;s soul has been taken&quot; discussion in that convo with Takemura? Is it because Brad didn&#39;t do the Mama Welles mission?
theRadBrad,I love takemura as a character he’s soooooo goood love how y’all just sat and talked about cats and life ooooh plus eating pizza
theRadBrad,V:I&#39;m getting worse <br>Takemura : you don&#39;t look so bad <br><br>That&#39;s hilarious 😂
theRadBrad,I got a feeling Brad won&#39;t get many &quot;Remain undetected [Optional]&quot; mission bonus moneys
theRadBrad,"I couldn’t finish the campaign on multiple characters due to certain bugs, but at least I get to watch Brad do it!"
theRadBrad,"You really should do riders on the storm, coz the reward is very useful and will help you do that Arasaka parade/Hanako float mission"
theRadBrad,"I cannot get over how similar V&#39;s voice is to Jon Bernthal&#39;s....it&#39;s like The Punisher is the main character, and featuring John Wick!"
theRadBrad,Does brad make these thumbnails? Or does he get the concept art along with the game? I&#39;m really curious. They&#39;ll make great wallpapers.
theRadBrad,"Brad was so excited to get that boss sniper rifle from Panam, and then he doesnt use it.  LOL!  It&#39;ll one shot pretty much everything on that map.  😊"
theRadBrad,Actually it&#39;s year 2077 here in Nepal so liked the fact that researched everywhere to give life to this city.... Also love your videos too brad❤️❤️
theRadBrad,"Just realized that when you break into a computer there&#39;s three levels of &quot;datamine&quot;, and the details about them are said below them, too, lvl 3 gives &quot;a large ammount of eurodollars&quot;"
theRadBrad,Johnny just jumping off the roof and cat following him is so funny
theRadBrad,"the Story of this game, and the VAs that bring it to live, are just soooooo amazing! thx RadDad for exploring alot of the dialouge, and for cranking out a part or 2 every day &lt;3 one thing tho: pay more attn to what weapons are/do, u scraped some srsly good guns already -.- and pls, start doing side missions, they heavily impact the mainstory and what options u get for certain things ^^ but even if u dont, i will enjoy watching, just hope u do the sidestories, maybe in a new playtru as Corpo * ^^ * best wishes for ur sweet Celmentine and ur Wifey, stay safe all together &lt;3"
theRadBrad,Wow. Jetstream Sam is officially my favorite character from this series!! i really do hope they make a sequel now!!
theRadBrad,"awesome video as always brad, i hope you didn&#39;t get as much trouble with this final boss as in the campaign with raiden."
theRadBrad,"Brad, my favorite MGS game is MGS2 because it was the first one I ever played, it got me into the series. I do currently own every major MGS game, even though I do not own a PS2/3."
theRadBrad,i have no clue which one is my fave. i love stealth and am not that bad at it but i love this too. lets me feel like a samuri/ninja
theRadBrad,"Brad awesome gameplay for metal gear JetStream , I enjoyed this one    .Still gotta get this Dlc , killer action and you play it awesome."
theRadBrad,"18:10 Still living cyborg on the floor
18:17 &quot;I feel like I&#39;m forgetting something...&quot;"
theRadBrad,Brad you should do all the VR missions so you can make your final review for the game as a whole.
theRadBrad,this game is soooo awesome!!!! i only got it a couple of weeks ago and i have been playing it ever since
theRadBrad,Can&#39;t believe I came back to this<br>😂😂 the good ol brad days
theRadBrad,I LOVE METAL GEAR RISING REVENGANCE mostly because of the slice n dicin and the EPIC soundtrack
theRadBrad,"you do come off as a real helpful person. you win, man. confusion averted."
theRadBrad,Woo! Can&#39;t wait man. I&#39;ve enjoyed your videos ever since Dead Space 1. Log onto youtube everyday just to see your videos. 
theRadBrad,"Hello Brad! I&#39;ve been watching for some time now, and I decided to finally comment. I&#39;m a med student from Cork, Ireland, and your commentaries have literally helped me survive some of the most atrocious case transcriptions and essay rewrites in history. I dig your sense of humour and the endearing honesty in your videos- you truly have a universal, Good Guy appeal. Mile Buiochas as Eire."
theRadBrad,I really like the story so far
theRadBrad,That face on the thumbnail is PRICELESS!!
theRadBrad,OMG I fell out the chair laughing at the thumbnail for this video what the heck!!!!!? :&#39;) (thank you for the laughs Brad)
theRadBrad,This DLC was not that long but it was still pretty funny to play as Sam. To bad there are no actual unlocks on it.
theRadBrad,4:51-5:11 best part of the video.
theRadBrad,"Metal Gear Solid 4, the last one. I can&#39;t wait for the new ones to come out. Ground Zeros and The Phantom Pain
Going to be amazing "
theRadBrad,I love how you can lunge off walls to counter-strike. 
theRadBrad,That thumbnail made my day thanks Brad
theRadBrad,"the dudes just crawling, no legs, arms nothing, and brad`s just like hmmm i feel like i`m missing something, man lmao i freaking spit the orange juice at my fucking phone laughing luv ur vids brad, good job, #1 fan!!!"
theRadBrad,While I really do enjoy this metal gear my favorite is metal gear peace walker for some reason it has my favorite gameplay and story by far.
theRadBrad,awesome game!
theRadBrad,this one is my favorite out of all of them 
theRadBrad,cabin in the woods was just crazy. elevators bringing different things that would love to kill you for some sacrifice
theRadBrad,"Greetings from Uruguay, I can´t stop laughing with your playthroughs"
theRadBrad,good job brad keep up the good you are so funny i hope i can meet you in person one day
theRadBrad,Can&#39;t wait for Phantom Pain!! ;D
theRadBrad,That one guy towards the end was still alive and Brad just passed him.  LOL.
theRadBrad,Going to be a tearful day !
theRadBrad,Imagine if they got story dlc for all the baddys
theRadBrad,"I love them all, to be honest. If I had to pick though, it would be MGRR."
theRadBrad,I loved the tekken reference there Brad
theRadBrad,this will be epic!!!!!!!
theRadBrad,"MGS 4 coolest ending ever 
"
theRadBrad,Brad you are the best man :D
theRadBrad,Glad to see that I ain&#39;t the only one who thought Cabin in the Woods hahaha great movie
theRadBrad,"Yup, It&#39;s going to start out as Ground Zeroes, which takes place a few days after Peace Walker, and then something during the events of Ground Zeroes (the prologue) causes Big Boss to go into a coma for 9 years, when he wakes up, Phantom Pain starts. But they&#39;re both the same game and make up MGS5."
theRadBrad,I love this metal gear game but I like the older one
theRadBrad,"Hands down, most hilarious thumbnail EVER!"
theRadBrad,"I didnt like this game at the begining of the serie, but as time went by It was very entertaining "
theRadBrad,5:00 I can&#39;t here anything over my laughter
theRadBrad,Brad i know im probably very late for this but if you still play this game you can press the left stick to move the character in blade mode
theRadBrad,Love your vids &lt;3
theRadBrad,people dying and brads like &quot;the plant fell over&quot;
theRadBrad,"Brad finally finds out that MGS Zeros is coming out, bit late there but glad you know now"
theRadBrad,"Great Campaign , fun too"
theRadBrad,Metal gear solid = the best of the series and still is!!
theRadBrad,"The thumbnail for this video xD 
brad your the best 
"
theRadBrad,"Yeah you&#39;re funny and relaxing Brad, no stress in commentary that makes things easier, and thanks for the show."
theRadBrad,"Great series. Love the commentary. I was waiting for part 28, great timing. Keep it up."
theRadBrad,It&#39;s awesome that you make these videos.  They help me get the experience of games that I can&#39;t always readily afford
theRadBrad,"I love the Dead Island series, great fun."
theRadBrad,I love that in newer survival horror games &quot;find&quot; something even though all you have to do is follow the marker 
theRadBrad,Another Kick ass episode! You asked before why we watch you..well my sis and I watch you because..A/ We love these zombie games..B/ Love watching others play esp as we have no guts to play it ourselves LOL....and C/ because you crack us up with your commentary! Waiting in anticipation for the next episode. Thanks! Your fans from The Bahamas!
theRadBrad,"you&#39;ve almost beat the game brad, keep going! i just beat it yesterday.the ending is awesome "
theRadBrad,"took me 3 days after release to complete this game. can,t wait to see brad complete it"
theRadBrad,I was really happy to see actual zombies in Leon&#39;s story of RE 6.
theRadBrad,"Resident evil 1 and 2 are deff my favs, but left for dead 1 and 2 were freaking epic when I first played them. "
theRadBrad,My favorite thing about this whole series are your gasps! It&#39;s the most amazing gasp I&#39;ve ever heard!
theRadBrad,"I like the telltale Walking Dead because of the options and story, but I also like Dead Rising (both 1 and 2) because the quests and the &quot;zombie mall&quot; scenario."
theRadBrad,For those wondering about team quest there nothing too special you get them supplies and they either improve the weapon they have or there shop.
theRadBrad,throwing any items at the tanks will make them explode
theRadBrad,the reason survival instinct did so well is because  brad+zombies=epic win
theRadBrad,"4:40 Brad miss a mod. that brings memories joy, fun and facepalms. I love it!"
theRadBrad,"Resident Evil can do no wrong in my eyes but strictly zombie, man thats tough but I can say my favorite zombie game/series is Dead Rising with certainty. I mean that was such a ground breaking title. It brought the zombie outbreak to full scale. You&#39;re in the middle of such a massive outbreak, not in a small slice of one."
theRadBrad,"Brad,you are using your speedy shotgun. It has a quick reload time but doesn&#39;t hit as hard as the slaughtering shotgun you also have equipped. "
theRadBrad,Its funny when a zombie pops up and scares you because your reactions are hilarious
theRadBrad,"need more, this game kicks ass
"
theRadBrad,"my favourite zombie universe has gotta be twd, but that&#39;s because it&#39;s one of the more in depth universes and I&#39;m really into the comics and stuff, but in terms of games, I&#39;ve never played the l4d games because I play ps3, but I imagine its pretty sweet"
theRadBrad,I just started watching you dead island walk through I started on part 1 again watching you play riptide you should replay both pick a character and you can use him -her in both games and yes the team quest make your team stronger with better weapons
theRadBrad,"The zombies will sometimes throw their weapons at you Brad, I think thats what happens when you see a NPC with a knife in their neck, zombie threw it at them HAHAHA :D  thanx for the vids!"
theRadBrad,I wonder when Brad will find out he is using the speedy shotgun instead of the slaughtering one.
theRadBrad,R.E. is a great zombie game and 6 was good to me . Great video!!!
theRadBrad,keep going i&#39;m loving these videos!
theRadBrad,"L4D games are classics, but they get old fast....TWD: Survival Instinct was fun for me as well, but I think out of the zombie games I&#39;ve played, Riptide appeals the most to me with the survival aspects and weapons and open world, etc"
theRadBrad,Great looking graphics in this game.
theRadBrad,don&#39;t you know? every game you play is gooooood!
theRadBrad,"cant wait for more dead island
"
theRadBrad,the best zombie game for me is the walking dead series on xbox live and then dead island is a close second but only when your playing with friends otherwise its just irritable great videos brad as always
theRadBrad,I think you should be able to save the pilot if you have an extra med kit if you want
theRadBrad,I love these zombie games! MORE!!! XD
theRadBrad,"been waiting like forever for this man, thanks."
theRadBrad,"teamquests, give them some simple items (most you already have) and they are stronger against hordes"
theRadBrad,&quot;how about you rescue me&quot; Brad you are so funny :D
theRadBrad,"More Brad MOOOORE!!!
SPAM US WITH THIS SERIES PLEASE!"
theRadBrad,"Brad, your videos are beast!"
theRadBrad,"Hey Brad, since this game is coming to an end soon, wondering if your doing Metro Last Light in a few days!? Awesome vid. keep up the great work ^_^
"
theRadBrad,I know this is old. But Brad you should use yours flares more often
theRadBrad,fave zambie game for me Left 4 Dead 2 :D love the series man keep em coming :)
theRadBrad,I hope brad does some more silent hell
theRadBrad,You need to make longer videos Braddd!
theRadBrad,"Brad! You miss-think the slaughter shotgun, it&#39;s way better than the Speed shotgun in damage. Use it more. You paid for it&#39;s upgrades, you&#39;d think that weapon would be your primary"
theRadBrad,@theradbrad Great episode. You have played this game amazingly. Enjoy each episode
theRadBrad,I cant wait until he finds out about the ending
theRadBrad,"Brad just a litlle tip: JUST LEAVE YOUR GODDAM FALSHLIGHT TO REGENERATE! Not evan 30% of it recharges and you just waste it, to last 10 seconds. Oh and sorry for the Caps Lock. :D"
theRadBrad,Love the dead island games
theRadBrad,Great Series! I am in GA as well. Call of Duty Zombies series are pretty good.
theRadBrad,Showin my age here but Biohazard on PS1 was a great zombie game. Played that when I was 12 and it scared me for life

Youtuber,Comments
GameGrumps,"I have a special place in my heart for this game.<br><br>My brother and I used to play it all the time.<br><br>EDIT: Of course you couldn&#39;t figure out the controls, Ross. You couldn&#39;t even make Shamu fire the cannons with the headbutt. I hear it could be useful for defeating enemies."
GameGrumps,"I remember playing this game, it&#39;s how I found out who plo koon was, now he&#39;s one of my favorite Jedi"
GameGrumps,Just seeing the intro flooded my mind with childhood memories. I actually really liked this game. The biggest gripe I had was the unforgiving platforming segments. Aside from that the co-op was pretty good fun.
GameGrumps,"Actually Ross is right, there are weapons in the star wars universe that arent lightsabers but can clash with them. Vibro Swords and Electro staffs."
GameGrumps,"I used to play this game with my dad all the time, I loved it. Seeing that big droid boss thing brings back a huge feeling of nostalgia."
GameGrumps,"Actually, Barry was right. Obi-Wan rides on a big lizard, specifically a Varactyl named Boga, in Episode III, not II"
GameGrumps,Barry&#39;s Star Wars name should be Kramus Barren.<br>And Ross as Donvar Ros.
GameGrumps,I loved this game as a kid! So happy to see them play it!
GameGrumps,"I remember playing this every time my brother and I went to my cousin&#39;s place. Whenever one of us had to wait for the other to catch up on platforms, they&#39;d start singing a stupid little line to pass the time."
GameGrumps,Me and my older brother used to play this game all the time. It&#39;s refreshing to see such a great game get played once again.
GameGrumps,"Man this game is so good, learning the move list for each character and doing the special moves is great."
GameGrumps,this was one of my favorite games as a kid!
GameGrumps,Plo Koon is legitimately my favourite Jedi. I&#39;ll remember this guys... <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;ll remember this.
GameGrumps,oh my god I remember playing this game with my cousin for a whole week one summer.<br>good times.<br>this is a great game
GameGrumps,The Barry Brian chemistry is amazing
GameGrumps,The nostalgia is strong with this one.
GameGrumps,"I remember this game! Loved it, oh gosh the memories."
GameGrumps,Oh my god I remember this game. I played the shit out of this as a kid and loved the hell out of it.
GameGrumps,This game is sooo good. Recently emulated it to play it again and it is still fun. I think they would like it if they were actually competent at games :)
GameGrumps,damn this brought back some serious nostalgia. played this game all the time
GameGrumps,"That intro to this game was pretty good, I mean it was very definitely a whole bunch of tech demo stuff  but the compilation worked pretty well."
GameGrumps,Brian discovering the term &quot;D-pad&quot; is the highlight of my day.
GameGrumps,Barry&#39;s monotone &quot;Now this is pod-racing&quot; killed me.
GameGrumps,"This whole episode is such a nostalgia trip for me. I never understood why Mace Windu has a blue lightsaber, and Plo Koon has a gold one in this game."
GameGrumps,"Ross can barely play a game that I completed at the age of 9. The controls are fine, Ross is a plonker."
GameGrumps,"As  a child, this game was everything I was wishing for. When I finally put my hand on it, oh my... Me and my brother were crazy of that game. Good memories."
GameGrumps,"I love this game,I played it in my childhood(too many times)"
GameGrumps,Really enjoying Ninja Brian&#39;s appearances.
GameGrumps,"So before adding Brian as a character, the Grumps just built him up and up and up as this all-knowing genius who is always right about everything. After seeing Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide and the few other episodes he is in, I&#39;m thoroughly convinced all he knows is how to convince a Grump that he&#39;s right. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he had no PhD in anything, but instead he just told the Grumps he did so they took it as fact. Never ever thought I would say this, but I miss Suzy being the third wheel on this show.."
GameGrumps,I loved the point in the movies when Mace Windu used a blue lgihtsaber and Adi Galia used a red lightsaber in a Shien Backhand grip<br><br>Good times
GameGrumps,dude this was one of my fave star wars game i love this one
GameGrumps,I absolutely loved this game when I was a kid! Had it on playstation 1.
GameGrumps,I really hope they continue to play this i loved it as a kid
GameGrumps,Brian is a lovely addition to the team.
GameGrumps,"The weapon you are looking for is called a vibroblade. Not all could combat it depends heavily on if they are properly designed with lightsabers in mind as they worked by vibrating the blade made from a material able to handle lightsabers at incredible speeds with an ultrasonic motor in the hilt to increase the power and had to be insulated with a certain kind of handle made of cortosis weave to prevent the motor from shorting out when coming into contact with lightsabers.<br><br>The droids are B1 Battledroids, B2 Super Battledroids are the larger more intelligent and tank-like ones, Droidekas aka Destroyer Droids are the ones that roll and are low in durability but are equipped with shields, Magnagaurd are the guardian droids of General Grievous specifically designed to kill Jedi.<br><br>Certain other weapons could combat lightsabers as well such as the Beskade, a traditional Mandalorian sword made of Beskar, a material only native to Mandalore with a level of durability that would be undamaged by a lightsaber, Mandalorians even had a flute with the ability to be used as a weapon against Jedi, ineffective of course but it had a sharpened end for stabbing and enough weight to be used as a club while being made of Mandalorian Iron. There are several other materials that do this. There&#39;s also one material I can not remember the name of that would disable a lightsaber for a few minutes as it would short out the weapon.<br> <br>The Hutt language is known as Huttese and has a full dictionary as does Mando&#39;a or the Mandalorians and several other Star Wars languages.<br><br>You guys are not exactly the most qualified to discuss what characters are good, such as Boba as I could give you legitimately why Boba is so popular, as you have very little Star Wars knowledge, let alone EU knowledge<br><br>Edit: Correction, the weapon you were looking for is an Electrostaff, a weapon made of phrik alloy capable of stopping hearts, another of the metals capable of blocking lightsabers, it was also used in the hilt of Sidious&#39;s blades used by Grievous&#39;s magnaguards, NOT IG-88, IG-88 was an assassination droid, not a magnaguard."
GameGrumps,I played this game ALL THE TIME on my Dreamcast! I could never defeat Darth Maul... I hope these guys can!
GameGrumps,"I remember how mindblowing this game was back in the day, because me and my cousins would play it a lot. However, now a days I see how it&#39;s aged a bit. Though I&#39;d like to play it one day"
GameGrumps,HAPPY STAR WARS DAY! MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!!!
GameGrumps,I was surprised that Ross knew there was a metal that can resist a lightsaber.
GameGrumps,Watching this makes me feel like im watching Mystery Science Theater 3000 play StarWars. Love it.
GameGrumps,You&#39;re thinking of a vibroblade. That shit can parry lightsabers.
GameGrumps,This was actually a really good game for it&#39;s time and it actually aged pretty ok.
GameGrumps,"OMG!! I played this with my brother years ago! Ah, memories ;)"
GameGrumps,I REMEMBER PLAYING THIS AS A KID. Wow. brings back memories.
GameGrumps,Lucasarts made amazing star wars games... Ross never ceases to disappoint
GameGrumps,Danny is moving up as one of my favorite grumps. how can you not like Boba fett?
GameGrumps,"Ross you&#39;re talking about cortosis. Cortosis is a lightsaber resistant material that can be molded into armor, and, on rare occasions, weapons."
GameGrumps,"I believe the sword Ross was talking about in the beginning is called a vibrosword. It was mainly used in KOTOR as the main melee weapon before you got a lightsaber, but it could actually collide with a lightsaber&#39;s blade."
GameGrumps,"Ninja Brian IS a legit genius.<br>The dude, when using his secret identity as his &quot;real life&quot; persona, works as a theoretical physics professor on MIT or something, last time I heard.<br>Ninja Brian rules."
GameGrumps,"I&#39;m just imagining Danny with a girlfriend who looks like Arin, but in makeup and women&#39;s clothes.<br><br>Like that hasn&#39;t happened many, many times."
GameGrumps,Maybe one day Arin will realize that the Screw Attack kills enemies...
GameGrumps,ARIN SOFTLY GRAZING THE SPACE PIRATES WITH THE SCREWATTACK IS HURTING MY SOUL
GameGrumps,Those last two space pirates were the bane of my original run.
GameGrumps,Someone please tell Arin that if you aim while space jumping it cancels it
GameGrumps,"As a Greek, I would want to say, Socrates is pronounced Socrátis. Like Sock rat ease."
GameGrumps,The sugar crash mentioned 2 episodes ago is in full force here.
GameGrumps,"I remember trudging through Norfair, trying to get all the little secrets and stuff on the way through while trying to make it to the end. I can&#39;t even remember right now what to do about those Space Pirates!<br>Good luck, Grumps! And I&#39;ll see you for the next one~!"
GameGrumps,I Googled the definition of &quot;lost&quot; and this is where it took me.
GameGrumps,"&quot;I&#39;m horrible at space jumping. Have I EVER mentioned that?&quot; - Arin &quot;Egoraptor&quot; Hanson<br><br>Think not, but we sure have."
GameGrumps,It&#39;s amazing how scary accurate Danny was when he called Samus &quot;Princess Metroid&quot;. 
GameGrumps,Is... Is it just me or did they skip that entirely obvious door to an unexplored area? The room with just the two doors. o_O
GameGrumps,"Dan&#39;s right about your vocal range, Arin. I think I got goosebumps whenever you went that deep!"
GameGrumps,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c2iKbx44dM&amp;t=2m16s"">2:16</a><br>Hear that? LADIES? The sex machine is siiiiiiingle!<br>FELLAS? Better lock em away no key no food no water starve them! <br>HE&#39;S MINE..."
GameGrumps,The matrix  is awesome and the second one was the best.
GameGrumps,"Yeah, you can tell a certain someone is crashing in this episode. &lt;3"
GameGrumps,"After hearing Arin&#39;s sass against Ninja Brian, I can imagine Ninja Brian reenacting the horse&#39;s head on the bed from The Godfather, except it&#39;s Arin&#39;s corpse on Suzy&#39;s bed. :P"
GameGrumps,I am legitimately enjoying this series even though I know this game inside and out. For me it is kinda cute how they make all these mistakes. it is like watching a toddler learn to walk and its very nostalgic for me because it reminds me of when I first played the game about 18 years ago.
GameGrumps,&quot;WHY DONT YOU FREEZING?&quot; <del>Arin Hanson</del> 2014
GameGrumps,And so begins the 5 video marathon of Arin fighting Ridley&#39;s guards over and over.
GameGrumps,"I love how Arin never got the X-ray scope, which would have probably helped him allot at points in the game..."
GameGrumps,I&#39;m honestly surprised Arin lasted <i>that</i> long against the black Space Pirates.
GameGrumps,Barry&#39;s puns are golden.
GameGrumps,"Apparently just hanging out with Danny enough makes you a better singer, because Arin is clearly getting better at this point."
GameGrumps,&quot;An empty pencil bag is like a........ like... its like a bag...&quot; - Danny Sexbang 2014
GameGrumps,I hate that your episodes are so short! they are so much fun.
GameGrumps,"For those wondering, Arin&#39;s low note is the B below the C two octaves below middle C.  So yeah, he&#39;s a bass."
GameGrumps,Every time I see Arin space jump it makes crazy
GameGrumps,"Those reflective Space Pirates seem pretty effective and good at their jobs. Shame the bad guys only have a few of them, because with an army of those fuckers, pretty much no one would stand a chance."
GameGrumps,"So, about the &quot;lava&quot; that hurts you, even though you have the Varia suit.<br><br>The Varia Suit (Variable Terrain Suit) provides improved defensive capabilities and is highly resistant to extreme temperatures, such as the heat of lava and sub-zero conditions.<br><br>Problem is, Norfair isn&#39;t filled with lava.<br><br>Norfair is filled with a highly corrosive acid that melts Samus&#39; suit.  This is shown in-game by being like...2 shades lighter than the lava in the rest of the game."
GameGrumps,"They call it the nth degree because n is commonly used to represent the degree of a polynomial, which is the amount of separate terms contained in the series. The idea is very useful in geometric sequences, where there may be an infinite number of polynomials in an expression, and it can&#39;t be represented without writing down infinite terms (which is kind of impossible).<br><br>Say you had to find the sum of all the integral (e^n) terms, but your range for n was between zero and infinity. You can&#39;t write all that down, because there are infinite terms for n. So you represent it as SUM(0&lt;=n&lt;=infinity) [e^n], and save yourself from writing each of the infinite terms out individually.<br><br>From there, there are special branches of mathematics that can actually do something with the geometric sums so it can all be represented in a limited, discrete number of polynomials.<br><br>By the way, I think Arin was looking for the word &quot;polynomial&quot; when he said &quot;polynigmion.&quot;"
GameGrumps,Arin can&#39;t join the Pen 15 club. He&#39;s already an honorary member of the D club.
GameGrumps,"I remember thinking at the start of this playthrough, oh hey, Arin&#39;s doing pretty good. They might finish this one...<br><br>Oh, how wrong I was..."
GameGrumps,Dat ending. So close to doing it.
GameGrumps,"He gets the screw attack, an ability that turns Samus into a spinning blade of DEATH!... Uses gun for everything and creates constant ice sculptures that block him at every jump... :|"
GameGrumps,I like how Arin conveniently ignores the screw attack&#39;s ability to kill enemies so that he can spend more time charging blasts and falling into lava.
GameGrumps,I really liked the one where they talked about pencils for a looong time.
GameGrumps,"Listening to the attempts at rhyming, non-sequitur jokes, and Arin attempting to space jump in this episode. . .yeah, the Grumps have crashed from their sugar high a few episodes back."
GameGrumps,Yay more grumps!
GameGrumps,I don&#39;t think Arin understands exactly how useful the screw attack really is. I mean it literally makes samus invunerable to enemies when active and it destroys most of them. Most of that would have been a lot easier.
GameGrumps,i could just feel the homoerotic tension seep out of this episode from Dann hahaha
GameGrumps,This show is approved by ducks.
GameGrumps,"Arin, the Pen15 club is no goddamn joke. Pen Island is real. I&#39;ve been there. As a matter of fact, I&#39;ve been the spokesperson for the Pen15 club ever since I was a very young child. My local pastor took me in a back room once and said &quot;listen here sonny, you ever heard of the Pen15 club? No? Well, you&#39;re about to be a member&quot; and my life hasn&#39;t been the same since."
GameGrumps,"You were close, Arin. n is used in Calculus as a variable that any number can fit in. This is ordinarily used in exponentials or multiplication."
GameGrumps,I would love seeing you guys play through Metroid Other M.
GameGrumps,"Hah, I was just about to be pissed that I finished the playlist so far, and then you angels added this one 37 seconds ago. :) Love you GameGrumps &lt;3 "
GameGrumps,I love love LOVE it when the Grumps are all wacky like this!
GameGrumps,"I&#39;m a full on pen user.<br>Stopped using pencils around 12 year ago, and I love it.<br>Of course, I&#39;ve had to use them when there is no other option, but if I ever have the choice I choose pen every time."
GameGrumps,Arin&#39;s becoming the new Jon and I like it
GameGrumps,Does the law of universe say that Arin must win by dumb luck no matter what?
GameGrumps,&quot;time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.&quot;<br>best. quote. ever.
GameGrumps,"&quot;That&#39;s not fair&quot; Suzy shouts, referring to a game entirely dictated by RNG"
GameGrumps,"I don&#39;t know why Suzy is shocked at getting second after leading 99% of the game, thats how all mario party type games work."
GameGrumps,"Geesh, how does Arin always come up from behind and win these games?"
GameGrumps,Welp. This looks like the end of Dustin and his amazingly sexy voice.<br>He should be on Grumpcade every time he comes to visit from Japan.
GameGrumps,Salty Suzy sang sour sad sufferings as she sat sorely in second spot
GameGrumps,The Finale of Amiibo Finale? Just what I was waiting for!
GameGrumps,So much for Suzy winning her first grumpcade. This was the most bs turn around I&#39;ve ever watched.
GameGrumps,"I am so glad Arin won and not Suzy, and no i do not hate her. It&#39;s the fact that she was DOMINATING everyone since the beginning, however she was a good sport about it (sometimes)."
GameGrumps,Dustin&#39;s humor:<br><br>&quot;Buckwild&quot;<br>&quot;Diabetes&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s it.
GameGrumps,Suzy! You&#39;re still the winner in our hearts!
GameGrumps,Dustin is just the perfect voice and personality for KK.
GameGrumps,I love how everyone noticed &quot;amiibo finale&quot; but not &quot;(ft. SoloTravelBlog&quot;<br><br><br>they forgot to close the parentheses
GameGrumps,"This was actually very fun to watch, Especially the Asspull ending.  I actually want to see them play it again"
GameGrumps,one of my favorite grumpcade series because of the commentary
GameGrumps,Arin&#39;s comeback was so amazing that it broke his amiibo
GameGrumps,"Gotta say, that was a pretty sweet comeback."
GameGrumps,The ending was freaking INSANE!!! I had no clue that &lt; Spoiler Removed &gt; would WIN!!!
GameGrumps,Am I the only one that actually liked this series?
GameGrumps,That last minute win was incredible.
GameGrumps,"I gotta say, Dustin as KK has got to be the best casting Game Grumps has ever done."
GameGrumps,Arins laughing was awsome in the end
GameGrumps,This series makes for an amazing sleep aid.
GameGrumps,"I really liked Suzy in this series, she was incredibly pleasant"
GameGrumps,i.. laughed SO hard at the end.. it&#39;s unbelievable.
GameGrumps,I actually want so watch more of this. Animal crossing always sinking its claws into me.
GameGrumps,"Gotta say, I laughed my ass off when Arin pulled out that last second win. Poor Suzy can&#39;t catch a break"
GameGrumps,Arin with the win from outta nowhere! Nice. Dustin is now my head canon for K.K. Slider&#39;s voice. So smooth!
GameGrumps,"Loved this series, hope they come back to it sometime! Just a super chill time with plenty of good jokes."
GameGrumps,Everything is zen when you get to hear solotravelblogs voice
GameGrumps,That was a brilliant ending.
GameGrumps,ARIN WINS! ARIN WINS. WOOOOOOO
GameGrumps,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx8IP4u2BOY&amp;t=19m03s"">19:03</a> that moment definitely needs to be in Best of February 2016!"
GameGrumps,Dustin probably had the most smug feeling when those turnip values crashed
GameGrumps,I love this game. It&#39;s so pure and good.
GameGrumps,That last turn comeback omg!
GameGrumps,We <i>need</i> more SoloTravelBlog for Grumpcade. More laid-back games too. It&#39;s a great combo!
GameGrumps,Woooah Arin coming into the lead from out of nowhere! x33 Amazing how the animal world works.
GameGrumps,I&#39;m so sad this is the final episode! I want to see more episodes!!!
GameGrumps,I feel like Dustin makes the perfect personality for K.K.
GameGrumps,Holy shit Arin what a comeback. That was the best.
GameGrumps,"Wow, that was rigged as f*ck! xD Oh, man... Now THAT was a come from behind victory! Damn!<br>Poor Suzy. She totally had this in the bag. Especially since that tarot card really payed off for her.<br>Thanks for the episode, Grumps! And thanks for joining, Dustin!"
GameGrumps,"Arin is amazing at these games, he loses all game and then magically wins in the last turn."
GameGrumps,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx8IP4u2BOY&amp;t=19m01s"">19:01</a> that Comeback"
GameGrumps,LMFAO As usual. Suzy is doing good. Arin sweeps it out from under her.
GameGrumps,"And on this day, everyone cheered knowing that the end had finally come."
GameGrumps,"Wow, that final turn.<br>On another note, this is the fourth Finale video this month."
GameGrumps,"Arin, that was the best turnaround. Bravo Arin. That was literally the most lucky turn around."
GameGrumps,Arin&#39;s last minute victory was fucking amazing.
GameGrumps,"Shadow sounds like an angry teenager. A very threatening villain. &quot;Only losers have friends, Sonic. At least that&#39;s what my mom&#39;s boyfriend always says.&quot;"
GameGrumps,arin: oh man is he gonna use chaos control<br>me: probably not i mean there&#39;s no emeralds in this continuity so what would even fue-<br>shadow: CHAOS SPEAR<br>me: ok
GameGrumps,"I kid you not, that pause sound effect has become embedded into my brain. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s funny as hell, but I&#39;m awaiting the day that I just hear a scanner beeping or a doorbell ringing and I suddenly  get flashbacks of Knuckles levitating to victory; while I sit there giving the thousand yard stare like I have SBSD (Sonic Boom Stress Disorder).<br><br>And it looks like Ross isn&#39;t the only one to spend mad dolla during Grump-time. Although Arin spent it on a piece of gaming history (and for that I salute him) while Ross spent it on...Amazing World...yeaaaaaaah"
GameGrumps,"What&#39;s with Shadow being an ACTUAL edgelord? Like yeah we joked about it but like,  the writers went as literal as they could with him."
GameGrumps,&gt;&quot;I&#39;m gonna show you just how weak you are!&quot;<br>&gt;Proceeds to get shit kicked out of him.
GameGrumps,Sonic literally kicked him into next week
GameGrumps,I love how this game has no connecting pieces or acts. And just suddenly Shadow.<br><br>Why Shadow?<br><br>Where&#39;d he even come from-
GameGrumps,"I must say I fully agree with Arin&#39;s view on Shadow the Hedgehog. Sure, maybe not the best game ever, but it certainly knew what it wanted and stuck to it to the end, not to mention it had very few bugs and glitches. It CAN get tedious to play though, I agree on that. Other than that, I would never place it on a &quot;top 3 worst Sonic games&quot; list because 1, there are many obscure Sonic games that are very, very underwhelming; and 2... it technically is NOT a Sonic game, to begin with..."
GameGrumps,"how does shadow exist in this world even?<br>how can he use his chaos powers if the emeralds aren&#39;t in this rebooted world?<br>why am I asking <b>you</b> all these questions?<br>MermaidMan, where are you?!"
GameGrumps,"Shadow saying loyalty is weak?<br>He was constantly going on about his promises to Maria and Gerald Robotnik before -_- Sonic Boom do you know anything about Shadow? Not to mention how all of the Shadow game was about who to be loyal to, friends or creators."
GameGrumps,"Props to Arin for actually saying how much he paid. It&#39;s a fair bit higher than I would have guessed, guess that&#39;s Grumps money for ya!<br>Congrats on it though, that&#39;s museum worthy."
GameGrumps,&quot;And you do NOT stop shitting&quot;<br><br>Arin and Adam have a serious problem. You need to see a doctor.
GameGrumps,"$1,175 for a terrible game that was dug up from a landfill.<br><br>Totally worth."
GameGrumps,"&quot;You&#39;re weak, and I&#39;m going to show you why&quot;<br>&quot;I should just finish you once and for all&quot;<br><br>At the end of that &quot;boss&quot; fight against Shadow, I was half expecting him to be like, &quot;Oh no, you beat me because I didn&#39;t use my full power to defeat you, like any villain should do&quot;"
GameGrumps,Was Shadow always this Fucking Psychotic? I Thought he was just more of a Reserved character that didnt like to talk that much
GameGrumps,This game really stays true to the &quot;new location without any explanation&quot; part of Gotta Go Fast
GameGrumps,I love how they present the Shadow fight like &quot;THIS IS GONNA BE FUCKING HARD AND THIS GUY IS GONNA WRECK YOUR SHIT&quot; and it&#39;s literally just 5 minutes of you beating the shit out of him.
GameGrumps,"When Danny asked when Arin had played a bad Sonic game, you KNOW he was THIS close to saying Sonic &#39;06. Nice save, Arin. You&#39;re good at never bringing up pre-Danny Game Grumps lol"
GameGrumps,Shadow turning into flowers...somebody needs to draw that now XD
GameGrumps,Shadow was actually made to appeal to the Western audience. Let that sink in--Japan thinks that Shadow is what appeals to Americans.
GameGrumps,"Bigredbutton makes me sick. They literally shoehorned Shadow into this game for fanservice, empty hype, and a cheap cash grab! Not only that but they went ahead and butchered Shadow&#39;s personality too! They couldn&#39;t even give a small explanation to justify his reason for attacking Sonic. No backstory, no motivations, no reasons for his inclusion. Completely insulting to his character and us fans. Disgusting. "
GameGrumps,"Shadow the Hedgehog and Sonic Boom are basically polar opposites. Shadow the Hedgehog had a pretty boring art style and pretty fun and overall good gameplay (in my opinion, anyway). Sonic Boom has a pretty good art style and absolutely boring and shitty gameplay (not to mention the glitches). The only thing they have in common is the bad story, which the first takes too seriously and the other glazes over entirely."
GameGrumps,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE5NR_Hq610&amp;t=2m43s"">2:43</a> Arin is thinking: &quot;Don&#39;t say sonic 06, Don&#39;t say sonic 06, Don&#39;t say sonic 06!&quot;"
GameGrumps,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE5NR_Hq610&amp;t=0m47s"">0:47</a> <br>knuckles sais<br>how do we do that without flying<br>subtitles read<br>how do we do that without frying<br>also there is no question mark<br>compared to the rest of the game this little part is a masterpiece"
GameGrumps,1175$ for what is probably legitmatelly the worst game that was ever produced... Arin is a madman...
GameGrumps,How does Shadow get his winged eyeliner so perfect?
GameGrumps,That scene with shadow appearing is so funny. Its completely outta nowhere and doesnt have much to do with anything. He jyst kinda shows up and is all &quot;ha! You have friends? What a nerd!&quot; And then they fight
GameGrumps,"I love shadow&#39;s first line: &quot;Not so fast, Sonic&quot;<br>What an apt way to describe the game"
GameGrumps,The whole cartridge thing is amazing. It&#39;s sweet that Arin is able to add that to his collection!
GameGrumps,"...by the way, why did Shadow fight Sonic again..? Was any plot established for that..?"
GameGrumps,"Shadow came, and now we&#39;re fighting, and now we&#39;re fighting Shadow!"
GameGrumps,I love the fact that they start talking about Shadow and then he shows up.
GameGrumps,I love how one of the most annoying things about this game is how they constantly over-explain everything you need to do and these guys STILL get lost
GameGrumps,"Arin has built a career and a company around gaming, plus his hobby is gaming and collecting games and gaming memorabilia. If you add up the cost of all the bits and pieces you use at your everyday job, then add in all the other equipment everyone at the company you work at uses, and then add in the amount you spend on your hobbies, you will see that Arin investing his money into that game for that price isn&#39;t really that ridiculous. Especially since he doesn&#39;t drink, smoke or do drugs either."
GameGrumps,I realized why this series is so entertaining. It’s because usually arin complains non stop with only a few real complaints sprinkled in. But In this series it’s the same thing but with real reasons.
GameGrumps,"Wow, this was actually a really great episode. Good conversation and nice in-game progression."
GameGrumps,"Omg, Arin said that it&#39;s not December, even though it&#39;s December 1st. Now we know the ugly truth of when these are recorded."
GameGrumps,I love how even a day later everyone exactly knew what Arin was going to do at the start of this video :P
GameGrumps,I find Arin&#39;s burps hilarious. No exceptions.
GameGrumps,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE5NR_Hq610&amp;t=9m41s"">9:41</a> &quot;The door is locked. Do you see a way to open it?&quot;<br>&quot;I think I can use my buddy bot on this door over here.&quot;<br><br>Oh, if only they&#39;d listened."
GameGrumps,Sonic after defeating Shadow: &quot;Requiescat in pace.&quot;
GameGrumps,"I went to a dollar store earlier today, and I saw a copy of Sonic Boom there, and I bought it. Brought it home, and surprised to see, the disc was there, tested and fully functional.<br><br><br>This game is worth a dollar."
GameGrumps,That Atari game he mentions paying $1175 for is now worth $1.1 million. Holy shit
GameGrumps,I love how Arin was trading to avoid saying death camp when they got to the bone yard.
GameGrumps,I love how Shadow is shoehorned into this game for no reason whatsoever
GameGrumps,"Oh man, this keeps getting better and better. Now Shadow shows up for absolutely no reason, fights Sonic, and then gets kicked through a time portal to who-knows-where so that he is gotten rid of just as easily."
GameGrumps,&quot;There&#39;s a method to the madness... It&#39;s just that that method is stupid.&quot;<br>That&#39;s the best line ever.
GameGrumps,"Danny, you&#39;re so damn infectious that I&#39;ve started laughing like you in real life. My life is changed forever!"
GameGrumps,"&quot;Shadow the Hedgehog knew what it wanted to be.&quot;<br>Arin, you&#39;ve officially gone over the deep end. There has never been another game in this world more unsure about what it was trying to do."
GameGrumps,&quot;What&#39;s up Shadow? Where&#39;s your neckerchief?&quot; kills me every time XD
GameGrumps,"This episode went from dabbing to a 14-minute deep conversation about hate, diversity, and values"
GameGrumps,i died inside when Danny and Arin talked about dying inside because i&#39;m an expert in the field of dying inside
GameGrumps,&quot;We&#39;ve never hated on any groups of people.&quot;<br><br>Clearly Dan and Arin forgot about those goddamn SPINICKERS! With their green nails and backwards knees that look like birds!
GameGrumps,"&quot;Spread the knowledge, not the hate.&quot; - Dan Avidan 2017"
GameGrumps,"I&#39;ll do my very best to be good to everyone, Danny and Arin."
GameGrumps,"Dan: &quot;People with gender issues get a lot of it, and their taking it from all sides.&quot;<br>Me: I&#39;m going to hell for laughing at that."
GameGrumps,Arin- &quot;I&#39;ve never openly said I HATE some type of category orrrrr thing on the show.&quot; Yet I remember subway arin I REMEMBER subway
GameGrumps,"This is why I love the Game Grumps. They aren&#39;t characters or anything for this show, they are people, and it&#39;s so apparent. It feels like i&#39;m just listening to a conversation and I love it. I&#39;m often alone (usually by choice) and these two make me feel like i&#39;m never alone. I don&#39;t even know if I should classify this as a show. These guys are so human and I adore it. If their aim is to be cool and to make people happy then I have to say they nailed both. Thanks a bunch"
GameGrumps,"As an expert in the field of misinformation, I died a little inside."
GameGrumps,It&#39;s so funny how they said they&#39;d love if they had a researcher in the background correcting them in real time and now they have Allie to do just that
GameGrumps,I really love Arin&#39;s mini stutters when he&#39;s explaining something seriously🌼 his change of tone while getting the thoughts out is just really sweet to me!
GameGrumps,Hate speech is never ok.... unless it&#39;s about those onion-breathed Spinnakers.
GameGrumps,I really liked the part where Dan and Arin talked about Dabbing for a loooong time.
GameGrumps,Arin: &quot;okay this is my chance&quot;<br><br>meanwhile im over here fully aware that he&#39;s about to get his ass handed to him by an array of lasers
GameGrumps,This episode is an explanation of why I adore Game Grumps. They&#39;re just some friends wanting to entertain random people through gaming. Anyone can enjoy. No matter the background.
GameGrumps,"Can I get an official game grumps shirt that says, &quot;Spread the knowledge, not the hate&quot;&quot;? I would wear that shirt so hardcore."
GameGrumps,"I love how at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE_7T2I9VqY&amp;t=17m30s"">17:30</a> Arin just walked in to a cult meeting and was just like&quot;see ya&quot;"
GameGrumps,<i>Game Grumps: A TellTale Series</i><br>&quot;We can finally fire Matt and Ryan!&quot;<br><b>Matt and Ryan will remember that</b>
GameGrumps,"This game is actually so sad. Imagine you&#39;re Link. You gather 4 friends and a princess and travel all across the earth until you face off against the threatening evil, Ganon. Then all of the sudden, you&#39;re mortally wounded and put into stasis, while your Bird-man rival/friend, fish-lady potential love interest, Gerudo warrior friend, one other (I forget who) get murdered brutally, while the princess is locked in a 100 year battle with the evil. You then wake up 100 years later and have amnesia and upon travelling the world again, you slowly remember your friends deaths and you are left to face the monster alone"
GameGrumps,"The commeters from the last episode were right, Arin totally ignored the memory literally right next to the shrine. GG, GG"
GameGrumps,"Dan and Arin wished for a person in the room to look things up for them, and now they have the Google supreme comander Ally"
GameGrumps,I like how the last thing Dan says before the episode ends is &quot;just use the battery from your vibrator&quot; 😂
GameGrumps,"I&#39;ve watched the botw series three times already, yet I still come back to it every so often. I feel like this was some kind of pinnacle for the grumps, or at least I enjoyed the content more, because they both enjoyed it so much. Although I don&#39;t want to presume how they feel. Anyway, love it."
GameGrumps,This is one of the dang goodest episodes ever. Getting so real!
GameGrumps,Danny thinking a new moon means that Earth has two moons is the most adorable thing I&#39;ve heard in a loooong time.
GameGrumps,"I love <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE_7T2I9VqY&amp;t=9m58s"">9:58</a> just because of how still Link is while he&#39;s being YEETED into the air and no one really talked about it."
GameGrumps,I love how Danny makes the hawkward joke like every month and arin reacts in the same way and then says caw
GameGrumps,Goddam I love you guys ❤️
GameGrumps,The polarity of game grumps episodes: sometimes it’s “we’re just here to make people laugh and interested and we never have intent of hurting anyone” the others are “ITS FUCKING NEVADA”
GameGrumps,"My reaction at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE_7T2I9VqY&amp;t=7m10s"">7:10</a><br><br>“Noooooooo the memory is right there go the other way!!!!”"
GameGrumps,I really liked the part where Dan and Arin talked about macaroni for a long time.
GameGrumps,"That&#39;s the delicate thing about gender issues... most people don&#39;t understand that it&#39;s a learning experience for everyone. I&#39;m trans and I&#39;m still learning shit about myself. Through my journey thus far, however, I&#39;ve found that I&#39;ve gained so much more respect by rightfully informing people instead of treating them like idiots for not knowing... that&#39;s what learnings about. It helps you grow. You&#39;ll get a way better response by showing kindness and informing them correctly than not. That&#39;s not to say everyone will be nice in return, but at least that way I know who I can trust to understand and those who just aren&#39;t really capable of understanding."
GameGrumps,We love you so much guys for being open about not knowing but not meaning any harm. Thank you so much for being brave enough to say you are learning and trying truly. We love you guys so much too
GameGrumps,I love when Dan talks like the mom from bobs burgers 😅
GameGrumps,"I really appreciate that they&#39;re trying to be good to everybody and understanding of things, even if it&#39;s new/unfamiliar to them :&#39;) That means a lot"
GameGrumps,"this is my second time watching this series through, and this is still one of the best episodes in terms of chill grumps and good vibes"
GameGrumps,"&quot;Yeah, I mean... fuck&quot; -Arin"
GameGrumps,I’m adding this to my favorites because of the commentary. I think it really touches on that middle ground of constantly attempting to be the best most informed human you can be and how to be excellent to each other
GameGrumps,"I enjoy these two men, they say good words"
GameGrumps,"Never stop being yourselves Dan and Arin, your fun and banter is why we keep coming back"
GameGrumps,I love these two. They&#39;re both amazing people
GameGrumps,"Damn, the game grumps are amazing :) this was an amazing episode like all of em :)"
GameGrumps,"Arin Regarding Politics: &quot;I&#39;m way into positivity&quot;<br>Arin Regarding Skyward Sword: &quot;I could say nice things about this game but why would I?&quot;<br><br>Oh Arin, never change guys."
GameGrumps,"I love watching the 14th recorded episodes that the Grumps do in a day, they always have deep or interesting conversations."
GameGrumps,"I just want to say, you guys are the best. This whole episode is representative of what makes you so awesome. Thank you for making me laugh every day and being so genuine and kind! Love you!"
GameGrumps,arin saying he cares about every single human being makes me feel special
GameGrumps,"Wow, you guys really poured your heart and soul out in this episode."
GameGrumps,"I love you both, and I always feel included! Thank you for being excellent to all us fans!!!"
GameGrumps,Darren and Arnold really got it right on this episode. Keep it up
GameGrumps,"I love Arin&#39;s cable rant at the end. Thanks for everything you guys do. Love the content, love you guys. Stay excellent."
GameGrumps,"Good job Ringo, you know what, we&#39;re gonna put that right on the fridge so everyone can see it!"
GameGrumps,"Came back to this immediately after hearing the sad news. Rest Easy, LemonyFresh 💛"
GameGrumps,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGPw3lwPxZc&amp;t=0m41s"">0:41</a> the slap followed by Dan deflating is such a perfect interpretation of that sound. Rest in peace Lemony, you will be missed."
GameGrumps,RIP to an absolute legend of animation
GameGrumps,"I’m making myself sad by watching more of his animations, being impressed and inspired by his talent, which thus makes me sadder knowing that he’s gone…"
GameGrumps,"Some of the art work in the background is just, beautiful."
GameGrumps,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGPw3lwPxZc&amp;t=1m49s"">1:49</a><br><br>What if those weren&#39;t clouds, but just God&#39;s huge, white Afro?"
GameGrumps,RIP LemonyFresh. An amazing talent taken from us too soon.
GameGrumps,&quot;Sometimes you get a ball rolling down a hill and you don&#39;t know it&#39;s gonna land on a heap of children&quot;  -Danny Sexbang 2013<br>XD I will use this phrase for the rest of my life.
GameGrumps,RIP LemonyFresh this is one of my all time favorite video
GameGrumps,"Rest in peace bud, your art will be loved by thousands if not millions to come"
GameGrumps,Man the animation in this one was amazing in particular. Great job!
GameGrumps,JESUS has some huge freaking eyes LOL
GameGrumps,beautiful work done by an incredibly talented artist.
GameGrumps,"This will always be one of my favorites. Thank you LemonyFresh for your incredible work, and RIP."
GameGrumps,RIP. I loved this guy’s animations
GameGrumps,"Amazing again to animate this, always a fun time.<br><br>I&#39;ll be doing a little AMA over on the subreddit if anyone cares. No? ..... Okay. That&#39;s cool."
GameGrumps,my heart... RIP LemonyFresh
GameGrumps,"I&#39;m a huge Beatles fan, so if I had the money and opportunity to buy one of Ringo&#39;s weird art pieces, I would.."
GameGrumps,Ultimate quote:<br>&quot;Sometimes you got a ball rolling down a hill and you dont know its gunna land on a heap of children&quot;<br><br>I love that he uses the word &quot;Heap&quot; XD
GameGrumps,...is Ringo eating the packing peanuts?<br>That&#39;s hilarious.
GameGrumps,I want to go to the Game Grumps fanart/Ringo MS Paint Art Museum.
GameGrumps,I had to come here after I heard about the news 😢<br>Rest in Piece Steve
GameGrumps,"Rest I’m peace Steve. You were a great artist, but an even better man"
GameGrumps,I’m so sad Lemony is gone but I’m so happy the internet exists so we can keep interacting with his art and keep it revolving through the algorithm for generations to come.
GameGrumps,Man this guy is awfully fresh
GameGrumps,I love the synced tilt when the both sign in unison. Favorite part of this animation.
GameGrumps,"&quot;Sometimes you get a ball rolling down a hill, you don&#39;t know it&#39;s going to land on a heap of children&quot; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGPw3lwPxZc&amp;t=1m53s"">1:53</a>"
GameGrumps,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGPw3lwPxZc&amp;t=1m04s"">1:04</a> was totally beautifully animated. Thank you, LemonyFresh! &lt;3"
GameGrumps,Anyone else notice how this artist does the Simpson&#39;s thing where God&#39;s the only person with 5 fingers?
GameGrumps,"Ayy, my art&#39;s at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGPw3lwPxZc&amp;t=0m09s"">0:09</a> to the right! Your animations are all so lovely and I love that you did an animated out of this clip!"
GameGrumps,"I love how you can pause this at any frame of the animation, and no matter which one, It will look infinitely better than Ringo&#39;s art. Great work on the animation btw."
GameGrumps,The animator did a really lousy job with his representation of Ringo Starr&#39;s amazing paintings...
GameGrumps,I like how Jesus beams down to the sound of F.L.U.D.D. charging up.
GameGrumps,Leave the art alone is damn iconic and a national treasure 😂😂
GameGrumps,RIP lemony fresh ♥️
GameGrumps,"I love this animation so much. The facial expressions, the smooth animation, the background art, everything&#39;s really amazing!"
GameGrumps,Can we all just appreciate all the awesome fan art in this video?
GameGrumps,"As a former HUGE Beatles stan as a teen (I still love them, but I was obsessed back then), I have seen all of Ringo&#39;s unique MS Paint art. So I was already laughing at the memory of it before Dan even reacted, and then his reaction made it even better."
GameGrumps,I was going through past GameGrumps animations to reminisce the old days and only found out now that Lemony Fresh passed away through recent comments. Always enjoyed his work whenever they appeared on the channel back when I was an active viewer. May he rest in peace.
GameGrumps,I love how he included legitimately amazing fan art in the background
GameGrumps,I thought the images in this vid were fake when I saw &quot;an elaphant foot&quot;<br><br>nope that&#39;s actually his art.
GameGrumps,He will be missed such a chad
GameGrumps,"I love Lemony Fresh&#39;s subtle hints that they&#39;re a Simpsons fan. In the Zuckerberg video, they made a Smarch joke, and in this video, they gave God five digits on both hands, despite the rest of the people in the video having four digits on each hand... Also, the name Lemony Fresh could be a reference to Homer&#39;s line, &quot;Mmm, lemony fresh.&quot;"
GameGrumps,&quot;Sometimes you get the ball rolling and you don&#39;t realize it&#39;ll land on a heap of children&quot;<br><br>-Dan Avidan<br><br>Actually a decent quote imo
GameGrumps,"I love the way they fall back together like that when they were both sighing, very creative."
GameGrumps,The animation is so fluid! Ahhhh I love it! And the fanarts in the background are a nice touch. Keep up the good work! :D
GameGrumps,ringo starr is a precious gem that must be protected at all costs
GameGrumps,"My inner Beatles fangirl is screaming that you made this XD THANK YOU for someone else calling Ringo out on the fact he totally made these in MS Paint, LMAO"
GameGrumps,My favorite animator by far. The subtle sounds and inflections they pick up on and translate into the animations are genius.
GameGrumps,I wanna see the pictures of arin and the pancakes
GameGrumps,"Every time we see a new Pivots animation I&#39;m convinced that eventually Arin is just going to be a pile of chins with eyes. He&#39;s getting gradually rounder and dumpier with each one, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if one of them ends with Arin being consumed by his own folds and turning into a black hole."
GameGrumps,"I&#39;m waiting for the day when one of these animators put so many chins on arin, that is entire body is just a stack of chins from chin to toe."
GameGrumps,"you cant lie to me, those arent pancakes theyre just arins extra chins"
GameGrumps,Arin&#39;s the key to all this. If we can get Arin working... he&#39;s a funnier character than we&#39;ve ever had.
GameGrumps,"The many chins of Arin are actually pancakes eaten years ago, still stuck in his throat."
GameGrumps,"Some say when a pancake is eaten, a chin is born. When a poop is pooped, a chin has passed on."
GameGrumps,I gotta love how arins neck is made to look exactly like the stack of pancakes and its even better that he eats the stack so its like he absorbs the stack into his neck
GameGrumps,Seeing those pancakes beside Arin&#39;s quadruple neck situation totally made my day. 😆
GameGrumps,"I went to Google for the pictures of Arin Danny said he had, and as soon as I typed in &quot;Arin eating&quot; the first suggestion was &quot;Arin eating out Suzy&quot;. What the fuck, internet?"
GameGrumps,"I love how he draws Arin, it makes me chuckle every time."
GameGrumps,Love it when PivotsXXD does the animated shorts for you guys! Maybe a short with this artist featuring some of the other grumps sometime? Super funny
GameGrumps,"I laughed so hard, my relatives were concerned for me."
GameGrumps,"I always love his animations, this is no exception &lt;3"
GameGrumps,I&#39;m always impressed by the amounts of neck rolls Arin is given.
GameGrumps,I love these animated stories. They are just so hillarious.
GameGrumps,Arin feeding Dan is the most sweetest thing I witness with my own ears
GameGrumps,One of my all time favorite animators (both for art style and humor)
GameGrumps,Those are some crunchy pancakes at the end.
GameGrumps,Good job animating this.  I especially loved the extra detail in Danny&#39;s picture of Arin with his stack of pancakes.  It reminded me of Ren and Stimpy.
GameGrumps,I&#39;ve watched this like 5 times now and it still hasn&#39;t gotten old
GameGrumps,"I loved this moment, and I&#39;m super happy to see it animated."
GameGrumps,I seriously think I&#39;d burst into tears of pure honor and happiness if I ever EVER got to meet Arin. Full on Wayne&#39;s World not worthy shit. He&#39;s just so great....
GameGrumps,Arin slowly deteriorating while eating those pancakes is the best part of this animation.
GameGrumps,"But Arin stores pancakes in his chins, he eats them so much he has neglected the fact he has become a pancake himself."
GameGrumps,"Every animation ThePivotsXXD makes is pure gold...and chins, cannot forget the chins"
GameGrumps,"the animator saw the perfect opportunity, and executed it perfectly"
GameGrumps,I am to this day amazed at how much his style looks like it could be a cartoon Network show
GameGrumps,I love how the entire conversation is about Arin&#39;s pancakes<br>While at the same time his neck looks like a pancake stack
GameGrumps,I love ThePivotsXXD&quot;s artstyle and character designs. Arin could never have too many chins.
GameGrumps,For each missing pancake Arin should get an extra chin.<br>That was a pretty big oversight.
GameGrumps,Omg the close up of Arin was amazing 😂😂 good job
GameGrumps,"I love how ThePivots puts the sound effects on point, &quot;it feels so good&quot;"
GameGrumps,I love ThePivotsXXD&#39;s interpretation of Arin. It makes me laugh every time I see it.
GameGrumps,this animator is always makes arin look so funny
GameGrumps,I really wish these photo&#39;s would be released already.I would be able to die happy after seeing the smiley. Thumbs up Arin and then the Struggling in pain Arin next to each other.
GameGrumps,PivotsXXD you did a phenomenal job on this.
GameGrumps,"A few dozen views of this video later, I just now see Dan feeds Arin the pancakes <b>and</b> the fork at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if3yOaCG8ow&amp;t=1m15s"">1:15</a>"
GameGrumps,I love the part with Arin next to the pancakes.
GameGrumps,I love the way he draws Arin. Like it&#39;s just fuckin classic and hilarious with every frame he&#39;s drawn in
GameGrumps,The canned laughter in this is perfect.
GameGrumps,There&#39;s something oddly endearing about the way Pivots animates Arin.
GameGrumps,Where did this thing with Arin having 20 chins come from!? I love it.
GameGrumps,"I love how Arin went from no chin, to beard chin, to all the chins in the world"
GameGrumps,"As someone who loves Pancakes, I really want to try The Griddle, but I have to say that Cracker Barrel has the best pancakes I&#39;ve ever had."
GameGrumps,LOVE this animation style!
GameGrumps,An animated and a best of in ONE DAY?! WOOHOO!!
GameGrumps,"You had to cut away right as Arin was gonna feed Dan, didn&#39;t you? Nah but seriously this was great, and loved the laugh track inserts for the authentic sitcom feel. Great work as always Pivots!"
GameGrumps,This guy is my favorite animators for all the game grumps animated bits.
GameGrumps,"It feels surprisingly disturbing in my head to imagine pancakes making a crunchy noise in someone&#39;s mouth and I would&#39;ve never known that without this video. Thank you, GameGrumps, for I needed that knowledge to live another day."
GameGrumps,Dialogue: Garbage<br>Plot: Slow<br>Characters: Plainer than graham crackers that taste like cardboard.<br>Gameplay: <b>THERE ISN&#39;T ANY!</b><br><br>Commentary: 10/10<br><br>And that&#39;s why I still watch this series.
GameGrumps,"&quot;This is the most risque thing we&#39;ve seen!&quot;<br><br>Dan, 15 episodes ago you were naked in bed with a fox spirit."
Youtuber,Comments

CoryxKenshin,dude its like i saw cory go from being energetic and crazy to energetic and kinda less crazy. Its pretty cool
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L19nsJqyIWA&amp;t=4m30s"">4:30</a> had me dead😂😂😂"
CoryxKenshin,Mr.Chip&#39;s part got me dying 😂😂
CoryxKenshin,Sebastian:&quot;A real soldier would have taken the safety off.&quot;<br><br>Cory:&quot;SHOTS!!!&quot;
CoryxKenshin,“A SOLDIER WOULDVE TAKEN THE SAFETY OFF”<br>Cory: <b>explodes</b><br>Everyone else: <b>explodes</b>
CoryxKenshin,When Cory encounters a guy in a game<br>&quot;Oh I&#39;m bout to kill this dude&quot;<br>-When it&#39;s a girl<br>&quot;DAT BOOTY DOE&quot;
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTdErbSvKho&amp;t=11m44s"">11:44</a> <br><b>Sebastian: Starts running</b><br>Zombie: <b>”HEY”</b><br><b>Listen closely</b>"
CoryxKenshin,Tell me why Sebastian has to kick the door like it’s the only option when he could just open it like a normal person😂
CoryxKenshin,"“Give me that limeade tho, I’m a little thirsty” 😂"
CoryxKenshin,Why would Cory NOT make a series out of this
CoryxKenshin,When he said a soilder would have taken the safety off i laughed myself to death😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
CoryxKenshin,Yo Cory that editing is always lit
CoryxKenshin,I’m watching this without my kids and I don’t care 🤷🏽‍♀️ 😂😂 6+ years of hearing you yell in my house‼️ keep it up you’re a whole vibe 😂😂😂
CoryxKenshin,I&#39;M SORRY BUT WHEN CORY SAID<br><br><br><br>&quot;Ohh-<br>this seems comprehensive doesn&#39;t it?!&quot;<br><br><br>I STARTED DYING OF LAUGHTER IT WAS THE WAY HE WAS SAYING IT
CoryxKenshin,Cory sounded like Chris rock when he pulled up the upgrade menu for weapons
CoryxKenshin,If Lilly had MLG glasses she could probably save herself!😂
CoryxKenshin,"Cory&#39;s laugh passed on to me , now I laugh like him and all my friends know it"
CoryxKenshin,Microphone: Carries Cory’s entire audio and make great audio.<br>Cory: MICROPHONE GET OUT THE WAY!!!
CoryxKenshin,"AH, that man falling down the stairs got me HOLLERIN."
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTdErbSvKho&amp;t=16m13s"">16:13</a> Cory&#39;s reaction cracks me up 😂"
CoryxKenshin,cory:dont move lily<br>me:*moves my phone closer to my face*<br><b>dude comes out of nowhere</b><br>me:OHHHHHHHHHH!
CoryxKenshin,This man gives hillarious ones..<br>Literally<br>Tearing guts off like TOILET PaPer<br>I m dead .
CoryxKenshin,i need some more of this series
CoryxKenshin,I really wanted you to finish this game 😣 the first evil within was my favorite.
CoryxKenshin,&quot;I&#39;m not a soldier. I&#39;m just a technician.&quot; <b>focuses on gun</b> &quot;Uh... I can explain.&quot;
CoryxKenshin,Cory your videos also make my day! Thanks for being awesome!
CoryxKenshin,&quot;Lily Screaming&quot;!! <br>Coryxkenshin: naw that sounds older.😂😂😂
CoryxKenshin,The lime-aid brings me back to when Cory did the first evil within lime-aid is that good stuff tho 😏
CoryxKenshin,When he said”come here boy” after smashing the monsters head made me laugh so hard!😂
CoryxKenshin,Very glad you exist Cory as you bring hours of entertainment to watch on boring stormy days.
CoryxKenshin,I got as excited as you did when the nurse came out😭 I liked her in the 1st one ! Love watching you play these !
CoryxKenshin,Corey I just want to thank you for putting a smile on my face everyday
CoryxKenshin,That jump scare with Lily and the man in the suit was so intense for some reason😔😔it made me drop my cookie in my milk
CoryxKenshin,CORY....JUST TAKE YO PILLS MY MAN!
CoryxKenshin,I like how Cory just runs up in their and kills everything and 8-bitryan goes all stealthy
CoryxKenshin,"love this game! its quite stingy with ammo as you know but other than that, its solid af"
CoryxKenshin,It’s 2023 and I still want him to finish this 💀🙄
CoryxKenshin,CORY YOURE BACK AAAAA💕I’m so glad I was getting worried! Glad you’re safe! All is forgiven!
CoryxKenshin,Ahh! Just kicking back with my feet up watching some Coryxkenshin👍
CoryxKenshin,dang double upload.. ur the funniest youtuber ever seriously nd ur edits... incredible
CoryxKenshin,Cory coming in clutch with a nighttime upload of a horror game. Slice that like button
CoryxKenshin,"Cory, make sure you explore all conversation options with the NPCs. That&#39;s how you start most of the side missions. and YES this game has side missions :D"
CoryxKenshin,2021 &amp; I still watching this I love the old days the old Cory simple &amp; fun just gameplay with pure reaction I mean 🤣 really funny Cory I mess Cory I really do
CoryxKenshin,Awesome gameplay my brotha
CoryxKenshin,"The jumpscares on The Evil Within 2 are more intense. The first one didn&#39;t phase me, BUT I&#39;M CATCHING A FEW JUMPS ON THIS ONE. Well done, Devs. Well done."
CoryxKenshin,Thxs mate needed my daily dose of evil
CoryxKenshin,just became a big fan of this guy. I hope to see more of this evil within2. keep doing ya thing
CoryxKenshin,CORY YOUR SO AMAZING THANKS FOR ALWAYS MAKING MY DAY...LETS GET THAT WOOOOOOOORK
CoryxKenshin,Your really good at playing horror games and I love to watch them 👍🏽
CoryxKenshin,This is the best reaction video ever 😁 please keep playing the game.
CoryxKenshin,Lily got more stamina than her dad
CoryxKenshin,The evil within is a good game <br>Make more pls
CoryxKenshin,"upload some more pleaseeee make a 1 hour episode or something. I want to sit back,relax and get my popcorn and watch you play."
CoryxKenshin,Corey is playing the newest Fnaf security breach and I had the urge to rewatch this. Still hits &lt;3
CoryxKenshin,I’m glad we’re all coming back watching this series
CoryxKenshin,Rewatching during quarantine and he just looks so different
CoryxKenshin,I&#39;m just now realizing how iconic fnaf sounds are
CoryxKenshin,<b>Warning sign comes up telling Cory to wind up the music box</b><br><br>Cory: proceeds to check the rest of the cameras except the one camera and also he somehow didn&#39;t listen to phone guy correctly<br><br>Me: <b>Facepalm</b>
CoryxKenshin,I love that Cory still wears that same necklace to this day. In all these years he’s never lost it.
CoryxKenshin,cory has perfectly demonstrated what a karen is.<br><br>i don’t need to put the mask on. i don’t need to put it on.<br><br><b>DEAD</b>
CoryxKenshin,"Phone Guy: “Keep the music box wound up.”<br>Cory: <b>neglects the music box until it’s too late</b><br>Also Phone Guy: “Put on the Freddy head if you need to.”<br>Also Cory: <b>doesn’t put the mask on when necessary</b><br>I mean, jeez! Do you really distrust Phone Guy THAT much, Cory?!"
CoryxKenshin,Cory&#39;s channel was in it&#39;s beginning prime. And still is.
CoryxKenshin,"Had to run marathon on all his FNAF vids after watching him played FNAF: SB. Literally grew up watching this man grow alongside  others like Ryan and Poiised, now I&#39;m in college. Doesn&#39;t hit me how time really flies until I watch his old videos again."
CoryxKenshin,Man it’s been so long… from this to him taking a role in the movie it’s crazy how this guy evolved from a gamer to an actor props to Cory.
CoryxKenshin,"Dang, the Puppet took a really long time before attacking him."
CoryxKenshin,phone guy: we gave you a freddy fazbear mask that will keep the animatronics out. cory: ok so i DONT put the mask on. me:😑
CoryxKenshin,The fact he lasted that long without the marionette on his first night makes me a bit jealous even though I’ve mastered the game now
CoryxKenshin,"Cory, if you didn&#39;t know, scott posted a new screenshot on his website that, when brightened, shows the marionette from the trailer drawings, the IMPORTANT thing to know is that the MUSIC BOX keeps the marionette at bay, when you see the red triangle, that means that you have to wind up the music box IMMEDIATELY!"
CoryxKenshin,"gosh, I remember when these games first came out<br>there was so much hype from everyone when each one was announced<br>i miss the old days"
CoryxKenshin,Cory can make any horror game fun bro 💀
CoryxKenshin,Just had to rewatch all his FNAF content. Brings back a lot of memories and laughs.
CoryxKenshin,"Jumpscares,<br><br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emtWAX7MB3M&amp;t=6m43s"">6:43</a>- Puppet<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emtWAX7MB3M&amp;t=7m46s"">7:46</a>- Toy Bonnie"
CoryxKenshin,"I’ve only ever watched Cory play security breach and I just had to watch all the other fnaf games he played and oh my word, I think it’s safe to say that cory’s skills in these games have improved a lot!"
CoryxKenshin,Currently having a Cory marathon on FNAF while he just made it to 11m.
CoryxKenshin,Rewatching on new year’s eve! CoryxKenshin’s old videos never get old!
CoryxKenshin,"Corey&#39;s reaction to the marionette was priceless. He just got up and walked around, mumbling to himself. XD"
CoryxKenshin,"Rewatching cory&#39;s old videos, you can just see how much he succeeded, cory really made a long way.. I&#39;m so proud I hope his success continues!"
CoryxKenshin,"Yes!!! I&#39;ve been waiting for more things of the second one. So cool that we get a demo when it&#39;s not even 2015 yet, the game&#39;s release year. So excited to experience this journey with you, Cory. :D"
CoryxKenshin,Game: We literally gave you the mask for the sole purpose of protecting yourself from animatronics in your office<br><br>Cory: No I don’t need to put the mask on don’t I? I don’t need to put the mask on! <b>Dies</b> Wait what??! I’m suppose to put the mask on???
CoryxKenshin,"From the looks of it, this game seems great--trembling atmosphere, suspense build up, and great new concepts except for the crappy jump scares, it needs to look more cinematic"
CoryxKenshin,"Been watching him for 5/6 years , this man WONT GET OLD ‼️🖤"
CoryxKenshin,Re-watching all Cory&#39;s old videos in order and it&#39;s still fire!
CoryxKenshin,Here in 2021 and old Cory still got the same energy I love it time has gone so fast
CoryxKenshin,My first coryxkenshin episode. I remember being so hyped for fnaf 2 and i saw this video while searching up fnaf 2 on youtube. Greatest choice of my life
CoryxKenshin,I love how Bonnie just slides into your view other then walking in.
CoryxKenshin,It&#39;s crazy to think this was 8 years ago and it&#39;s great to see how he improved in editing and how he grew up
CoryxKenshin,"Your instant replays are great, man! Really make the vids so good!"
CoryxKenshin,"These videos help me sleep at night and make me feel comfortable and comforted, thanks Cory :)"
CoryxKenshin,I love his confusion and then realizing what he got wrong.
CoryxKenshin,cory has grown so much yet he still has the same personality I love him so much he really is the shogun it&#39;s so nostalgic to watch him play this game cuz he was like this when mark was at his prime years now Hes arguably better than mark this just go&#39;s to show greatness takes time and cory really is greatness.
CoryxKenshin,I don&#39;t know what was a bigger surprise today: Seeing all these awesome let&#39;s plays of the demo or the full release of the game.
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emtWAX7MB3M&amp;t=1m22s"">1:22</a> man I feel like this was back when Cory actually had more of a passion of being a YouTuber. I feel like he just seemed more happy."
CoryxKenshin,my mans was 18 here. now he 25 and still going strong. love you cory 💕
CoryxKenshin,He still keeps the same energy nearly 8 years later. Much love ❤️
CoryxKenshin,I love how Cory&#39;s first instinct was &quot;I keep the mask off right?&quot;
CoryxKenshin,I&#39;m watching all of Cory&#39;s fnaf play throughs bc I wanna be apart of the fandom and understand the lore
CoryxKenshin,"Every first night for Cory is a cringe fest, because it always takes him an extra minute to understand before he&#39;s dead 😂"
CoryxKenshin,Gotta say watching this now quite a few years after this game came out and after watching mark it’s so dang surprising that the way he’s doing this is working
CoryxKenshin,Cory’s FNAF series is literally my favorite series ever
CoryxKenshin,"Watching this during quarantine, also, Cory screaming scares me. Not even the jumpscares"
CoryxKenshin,after watching him play security breach i was urged to come back here. thanks cory
CoryxKenshin,All you need to do for night 1 is keep the camera up and wind the music box. The new animatronics don&#39;t attack you if you have the camera up.
CoryxKenshin,I&#39;m barely playing these games and I love watching Cory cause he helps me under what NOT to do.
CoryxKenshin,I love what you&#39;ve done with the censoring of the cuss words. Fantastic!
CoryxKenshin,Still excites me seeing the intensity even after seeing it twice before. That&#39;s how good the tension is. xD  So excited for more Dead Space! :D
CoryxKenshin,I like how you voiced over the swear words Cory lol
CoryxKenshin,8 years later and still fire
CoryxKenshin,He got SO lucky. I am loving this so much already
CoryxKenshin,"This gon&#39; be a good lets play :D by the way, those trucks that got messed up by your stasis early in the video are supposed to be unmanned. I think most people in this universe would be traveling by those flying cars you saw out the window of isaacs apartment"
CoryxKenshin,Cory that intro was amazing!! You should do it more for games like this!! WOW!!
CoryxKenshin,Cory why is your voice hypnotic it makes me crave more everytime you talk~
CoryxKenshin,I actually played dead space two but I was too afraid to finish the game that game was scary OMG
CoryxKenshin,Awesome Cory still good as all ways
CoryxKenshin,I&#39;m glad they did the recap in the beginning of the game otherwise I would be so confused. Haha.
CoryxKenshin,That comeback tho..👍
CoryxKenshin,"Awesome, Thank You. Bless You. Keep up the good work."
CoryxKenshin,I&#39;m watchin this in 2016 and when he had the parts where he blocked the cussing had me dead
CoryxKenshin,lol your censors made me laugh. I love it!
CoryxKenshin,You know you can pick up the spikes and throw the spikes  at other zombies
CoryxKenshin,If the Ebola breaks out remember ill always be ya samurai brotha Cory keep up the vids
CoryxKenshin,Cory starts referenceing gears me starts staring off into distance fortunate son intensifies
CoryxKenshin,"Ah, (cory kenshin&#39;s voice) Darn        instead of shit lol your the best haha "
CoryxKenshin,Cory I love your vids so much I am thinking of becoming a YouTuber my self you are the best YouTuber of all kind!!!
CoryxKenshin,"Around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4Hx-7kue0&amp;t=4m04s"">4:04</a>, God created us in his image. So, we’re hardwired to emulate God."
CoryxKenshin,Watch out for the necromorphs
CoryxKenshin,Am I the only one who thinks that Danik looks like some strange combination of Elvis Presley and Jeff Goldblum?
CoryxKenshin,I love you Cory you are the BEST!!!:p
CoryxKenshin,you are the best YouTuber
CoryxKenshin,The &quot;Darn&quot; thing is funny
CoryxKenshin,Who&#39;s here after Cory&#39;s remake playthrough
CoryxKenshin,The censors💀
CoryxKenshin,Does anyone know how subscribers Cory had at the time he made this vid
CoryxKenshin,WWHYY DO YOU ALWAYS END IT WHEN THE AWESOME STUFF HAPPENS!!!! :-(
CoryxKenshin,you are the best
CoryxKenshin,i love your video samurai brother
CoryxKenshin,"10th View! (sorry, had to do it) XD I love how you censored every cuss with &quot;darn&quot; or &quot;booty&quot;. Just waiting &#39;till you get to that part! Half of the ep. will be you that one part, or maybe I&#39;m just really bad at the game. idk."
CoryxKenshin,Ilitterally said &quot;nnoooooo!&quot;atthe end xD
CoryxKenshin,You don`t have to do head shots
CoryxKenshin,Cool vid
CoryxKenshin,So HES the final Boss coryxkenshin you have to stop him ok coryxkenshin good lock man.

CoryxKenshin,Just got  done playing dead  effect
CoryxKenshin,LETS GO THE KING IS BACK!
CoryxKenshin,I love how Cory put the charlie clip next to the prisoner class and Charlie literally chose that class
CoryxKenshin,Let’s take the moment to appreciate how much effort Cory put in His content for us. Great job ❤
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnpjxeDDThw&amp;t=10m04s"">10:04</a> “I hate when they do that in games… ‘oh you were supposed to lose’… like, I DIDN’T WANNA LOSE.”<br><br>Cory’s wisdom is unmatched"
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnpjxeDDThw&amp;t=4m26s"">4:26</a> <br>&quot;when we said add black people to the game this is not what we meant&quot; <br>im still crying this dude is top 5  funny asf"
CoryxKenshin,Y’all can not tell me that Cory did not have the biggest glow up from 6 years ago to now
CoryxKenshin,Finally the King is is back &lt;3

CoryxKenshin,Cory getting hyped up for beating the tutorial boss is the funniest thing ive seen today
CoryxKenshin,I want to see him complete Elden Ring I would love to see this being a series he will complete with funny/rage moments
CoryxKenshin,"Personally, I would love to see a full playthrough on this channel."
CoryxKenshin,I KNEW THE SHOGUN WASN’T GONNA MISS THE ELDEN RING SMOKE LET’S GO!!
CoryxKenshin,been going through some tough times lately but a cory vid always makes my day
CoryxKenshin,"Everyone else - &#39;Wow, this game is amazing! The bossfights feel so intricate!&#39;<br>Cory - &#39;t r e e&#39;"
CoryxKenshin,This is why I love Cory he makes me wanna play games I never cared about
CoryxKenshin,"I watched your first reactions to the game and i remembered my own.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnpjxeDDThw&amp;t=26m06s"">26:06</a><br>That&#39;s the difference between (you) a souls player and a completely new Elden Ring player like me.<br>I died on that dude countless times before i could kill him. I even thought that he was a mini boss.<br>And im &quot;proud&quot; to say that it took me 5+hours to kill Margit. I said at the time &quot;damn this is going to be fun&quot;!!<br>I loved the difficulty of the game especially as a new (souls) player. <br><br>Now i can solo kill Malenia as a walk in the park :), which by the way is my favorite boss of the game!! Awesome fight!!!"
CoryxKenshin,"Damn I remember playing this game nonstop when it first came out and after a few months it feels so old yet so memorable, I wish I could replay it"
CoryxKenshin,That intro had NO BUSINESS being that absolute fire
CoryxKenshin,i love this man’s humor he gets me every time😂
CoryxKenshin,You playing Elden Ring is so enjoyable!! And that goes for a lot of games that I thought I wouldn&#39;t take interest in but when you play you make it so funny and engaging! Take your breaks Cory!
CoryxKenshin,"Cory is the only person that can make a play through into an anime intro,props"
CoryxKenshin,I love Cory’s videos so much I would literally watch him anywhere I’ll be shopping with my mom and I would be glued to my phone and end up running into someone’s cart lol
CoryxKenshin,But can we get more Elden Ring?  I&#39;d slice all those like buttons for another anime-style Samurai montage from Cory.
CoryxKenshin,"This man is an actual genius. Whether this is intentional or not, him leaving for long periods of time actually helps him a lot. It gives people time to catch up on old videos, and gets people even more hyped for when he makes each comeback"
CoryxKenshin,Cory really put his heart and soul in this video to make it the most entertaining as possible 🥹
CoryxKenshin,Is it just me or should Cory start voice acting games?
CoryxKenshin,&quot;you are fated to die in obscurity&quot;<br>cory: &quot;whatchu mean by that?&quot;<br><br>🤣💀
CoryxKenshin,lets just take the time to appreciate cory&#39;s hard work and time into making these videos. we love you cory !!!
CoryxKenshin,"I feel like every time I take a break from watching YouTube, so does Cory."
CoryxKenshin,Cory : I am about to finish this game.<br><br>Also cory : didn&#39;t upload any new elden ring video.
CoryxKenshin,Cory is like that one cool uncle who is around all the time then leaves for a few months without any communication then randomly pops by your house with a whole bunch of presents during the holidays 💀
CoryxKenshin,i have never laughed this much at any of your videos . today was rough thanks for making me smile❤
CoryxKenshin,"Its good to see you playing and not fighting everything you see, when i played i fought everything from the merchant to the person who helps you learn the game, i didnt learn anything seeing as i saw them and immediately stabbed them and died 7 times without stop and i was forced to run away and kill the merchant"
CoryxKenshin,You know you are about to enjoy it when you drop a like before the video even starts
CoryxKenshin,Corey showed up when it counted the most! I&#39;m HAPPY
CoryxKenshin,"Lol, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnpjxeDDThw&amp;t=18m26s"">18:26</a> &#39;is everyone friendly here?&#39; love it. Not gonna lie i literally did the same exact thing."
CoryxKenshin,"Today is a good day, Cory returned playing the best game of this year, what more could we ask for?"
CoryxKenshin,I’m happy Cory is back!! Playing a rage game full of moments here you will die multiple times and he used a mass effect song after a joke. This vid has everything
CoryxKenshin,"I like how opposed to previous games, the introduction of characters aren&#39;t actually enemies."
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnpjxeDDThw&amp;t=5m24s"">5:24</a> my sister was playing this for the first time in the living room and we starting laughing hysterically it caught us off guard so bad"
CoryxKenshin,Cory I was having a bad day I was overthinking I come to watch you and you made my day better keep up everything you doing love you man💯💯
CoryxKenshin,I love how Cory said “that’s what we do” as he stood up out of his chair with a shirt on about drugs
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnpjxeDDThw&amp;t=1m22s"">1:22</a> “Games like this.. comes once in decade.” -Coryxkenshin <br><br>You mastered the art of that as well I see😂"
CoryxKenshin,When cory said &quot;he said the name of the game in the game&quot; had me dead💀............🤣 i couldn&#39;t breathe.. love u cory❤
CoryxKenshin,He never fails to make me happy
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnpjxeDDThw&amp;t=3m50s"">3:50</a> the fact that Charlie actually picked prisoner is makes this clip funny 😂😂😂😂"
CoryxKenshin,Is it just me  or I&#39;m loving these daily uploads WE LOVE YOU CORY❤️❤️❤️❤️
CoryxKenshin,&quot;Woke up got folded went back to sleep&quot; got me dead 😂
CoryxKenshin,HE HAS RETURNED EVERYONE!!! no worries Cory take breaks whenever you need too. But glad to have you back
CoryxKenshin,We Appreciate all the hard work that you put into your editing
CoryxKenshin,"Episode 4: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FwGdCDyhR0&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLxoHK1S7LhWQBBAjqsRSuRc-WFKaAGTZ9"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FwGdCDyhR0&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLxoHK1S7LhWQBBAjqsRSuRc-WFKaAGTZ9</a>"
CoryxKenshin,&quot;Look at my wife isn&#39;t she the most beautiful woman alive?&quot;<br><br><br><b>abandons her for 3 months in a zombie apocalypse</b>
CoryxKenshin,oh my god when aj called out “Clem” my heart melted 😭😭
CoryxKenshin,"Nah Cory your choice wasn’t too harsh, most players hit badger’s skull so hard there was nothing but guts and brains."
CoryxKenshin,cory was one the few and only people I’ve seen do playthroughs that didn’t want javi yo date kate because he had morals and reallyed cared about david.
CoryxKenshin,"I really wanna know what was Paul doing before the apocalypse, that dude has mad combat skills and nothing has been said about his past. He is such an interesting character. Him and Clem are my favourites out of all the seasons."
CoryxKenshin,"Something you probably didnt realise, when Clem is humming, its actually the season 1 theme. And in the background during the AJ scene, its also the season 1 theme but slowed down and a bit different."
CoryxKenshin,"Cory trying so hard to avoid a relationship that the story is pushing is EVERYTHING. The devil works fast, but Cory works faster."
CoryxKenshin,Cory: <b>*finishes the game*</b><br><br>Me:*<b>rewatches everything*</b>
CoryxKenshin,"in this episode, he lost all feelings for kate 😂😂😬"
CoryxKenshin,"I love that every YouTuber chose to go along with Kate&#39;s motions, making Javi look like he had something with her, but here&#39;s Cory and he&#39;s just chillin lmao<br>He really wanted Elenor, not no KATE. Love that there was a love triangle. Javi loved David, David loved Kate, Kat loved Javi."
CoryxKenshin,"&quot;How did they survive for three months?! WHAT THEY EAT!??!?!?!&quot;<br><br>Cory I&#39;m pretty sure they are Latinos. We ALWAYS have food, and can good. Trust there is always something to eat."
CoryxKenshin,cory: &quot;eleanor is dead to me&quot;<br>also cory less than 5 minutes later: &quot;CAUSE I&#39;M MOVING IN BOY&quot;
CoryxKenshin,"When Cory killed Badger,I was like,&quot;Damn,he&#39;s roadkill.&quot;"
CoryxKenshin,"Cory, you know how many times I come home from a stressful day to watch you? You are my go to answer for stress. You help in my darkest times. Bringing me back up. Just thank you 😀"
CoryxKenshin,Did y&#39;all see how fast Cory switched up on Eleanor 😂😂 first he says Eleanor was dead to him then Tripp talks about her and he starts getting a little hype 😂😂 “i was pushing up on that&quot; (makes creepy face😋😋)😂😂😂😐😏
CoryxKenshin,Random lady: “sorry but the rest of you have to go straight to quarantine”<br>People in 2020: 😐
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHTcK6FY6xI&amp;t=14m48s"">14:48</a> At this moment Cory realized that time he said to Kate &quot;we can pull over&quot; LMAO XD"
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHTcK6FY6xI&amp;t=52m14s"">52:14</a> I’m in tears man his first words were clen but she had to leave him because she sacrificed the last shot for aj"
CoryxKenshin,“My man Gabe always been crazy bout dem pudding pops...Kate’s always been a weed-head.” I’m dead man.😂😂😂EDIT:ALSO IT BOGGLES MY MIND HOW DAVID DID NOT ASK ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER YET!!! I hate to say it but...maybe he meant to kill her and Kate.EDIT:never mind David’s good.....for now😒
CoryxKenshin,When javi called max a cousin-f!!king dirtbag I died <br>😂😂😂😂 Good gameplay btw
CoryxKenshin,Javi: “I doubt he’ll mind” no one: me getting the joke after watching it multiple times 😃
CoryxKenshin,It made me more sad that Kenny didn’t get to see Aj grow up and say his first word but he can watch over them like Lee is doing too
CoryxKenshin,i love rewatching older cory vids
CoryxKenshin,Cory: <b>at the beginning</b> NOBODY is gonna  die this episode. <br>Also Cory: <b>Bashes Badgers head in with baseball bat</b> YESSSSS LETS GOO!!😂😂😂❤️
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHTcK6FY6xI&amp;t=10m58s"">10:58</a> Cory&#39;s reaction is so crisp LMAO"
CoryxKenshin,cory is so confused lol he said &quot;kate wanna date both the brothers&quot; <br>Kate: <b>*tries everything to get away from david(her husband that she doesnt love anymore)*</b><br><br>and also cory said &quot;why didnt she divorce him&quot;...maybe bc there was an apocalypse lol
CoryxKenshin,“PICK UP THE BAT! *screams*”<br><br><br><br><br><b>The greatest quote</b>
CoryxKenshin,David’s face tho after Clem said “her friend took a crowbar once”
CoryxKenshin,Max I&#39;m glad you kept him alive I got emotional when he started begging on his knees to live I agree with you Cory he wasn&#39;t about that savage life and even if he turned against the frontier and went on our side they would of killed him anyway badger was the real idiot.
CoryxKenshin,When i grow up i wanna kick all my problems in the face just like Paul☺
CoryxKenshin,I dont think you understand how much i crave for you to make a new episode. I even click on my notifications to check if you have uploaded everytime. Keep up the work my fellow samurai.
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHTcK6FY6xI&amp;t=9m24s"">9:24</a> Darn it Cory! That was actually a real good flow, I was into it! Do more!"
CoryxKenshin,Yo this video had me dying I love how cory feels like hes in the game and the roasting
CoryxKenshin,"3 months? Did you realize while Javi and his family was packing to leave their home at the same time Clem and Lee was at the motor inn bout to meet cannibals? wow connections, man"
CoryxKenshin,Who else balled their eyes out when AJ called out for Clem? 😭😭😭
CoryxKenshin,Who else was dying by the intro??😂Lol
CoryxKenshin,Paul is lowkey the GOAT.
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHTcK6FY6xI&amp;t=1h05m22s"">1:05:22</a> that moment when you in your game kept on hitting him and cory is like nah I&#39;m good 😂😂"
CoryxKenshin,the walking dead is such a goated game man i love corys reaction to every game he plays i wish we was able to see season 2 from cory to see his reaction to that season
CoryxKenshin,"The face Cory makes when he sees Tripp hug Eleanor at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHTcK6FY6xI&amp;t=12m40s"">12:40</a>"
CoryxKenshin,“Kate wanna date both the Brothers Im Done”😂😂😂
CoryxKenshin,Cory&#39;s videos are what cured my depression. Yes Cory I am your illegitimate child 😂
CoryxKenshin,"i was dead at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHTcK6FY6xI&amp;t=1h08m11s"">1:08:11</a> cause cory just pulled up a little cross lololol 😂😂😂😂"
CoryxKenshin,Javi: that’s the Big Dipper.<br>Cory: wait..hol’ up.. it IS?
CoryxKenshin,i think this is one of the only games where cory was constantly just confused and stressed
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHTcK6FY6xI&amp;t=44m09s"">44:09</a> clementine showing up was the best moment of this video"
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHTcK6FY6xI&amp;t=1h01m34s"">1:01:34</a> - Javi And David Go!<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHTcK6FY6xI&amp;t=1h03m43s"">1:03:43</a> - Yes! Go Javi!<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHTcK6FY6xI&amp;t=1h03m29s"">1:03:29</a> - Uh Oh<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHTcK6FY6xI&amp;t=1h03m35s"">1:03:35</a> - Javi&#39;s Revenge About Kill Badger<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHTcK6FY6xI&amp;t=1h04m58s"">1:04:58</a> - Kill Badger"
CoryxKenshin,"Joan: it’s something I’m going to live with<br>Cory: no, you ain’t gonna live"
CoryxKenshin,"Even though I got triggered at a few of your choices, I still loved your thinking and reactions :)"
CoryxKenshin,take a shot everytime he says &quot;welcome&quot;
CoryxKenshin,"Cory’s rap at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgMqIlgXlyI&amp;t=15m15s"">15:15</a> was actually so good, “feel free to take a break whenever needed progress will not be impeded” hit hard"
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgMqIlgXlyI&amp;t=50m33s"">50:33</a> the way Cory looks directly at us just kills me every time 💀"
CoryxKenshin,"The fact these are  true stories makes the game so much more scary , unless that’s cap either way it’s still scary and such a well made game, and of course watching Cory playing it makes it better"
CoryxKenshin,the first jumpscare made my soul go outside of my body and fall back into it
CoryxKenshin,“If I cant have you….. none should.” Really hit the yandere there 😂
CoryxKenshin,I like how sometimes cory gets jumpscared so hard he doesn&#39;t even scream. He just sits there like he&#39;s reflecting on the consequences of his actions.
CoryxKenshin,"I’m kinda surprised Cory didn’t notice that it said dees nuts at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgMqIlgXlyI&amp;t=16m27s"">16:27</a> 😂😂"
CoryxKenshin,Cory is a legend at finding the weirdest horror games
CoryxKenshin,"This part made me laugh to hard <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgMqIlgXlyI&amp;t=15m19s"">15:19</a> ”Step one don’t be rude that’s kinda rude, that’s kinda cruel who is this dude uhh.”"
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgMqIlgXlyI&amp;t=42m21s"">42:21</a> Cory: Gasp! It&#39;s my flashlight!<br>Doesn&#39;t even question why it&#39;s just floating there behind an invisible wall.<br>And then he gets jumpscared by some legs."
CoryxKenshin,the fact that she’s just standing there waiting to scare you makes it scarier
CoryxKenshin,Cory realizing it’s Berleezy voice before Berleezy realized it was his own voice is hilarious yet wholesome to me 😂
CoryxKenshin,I&#39;ve never gotten this scared when watching horror game video. I can&#39;t imagine how it&#39;ll be if I was playing. Props to the devs!
CoryxKenshin,"I don’t scared easily, but Corey’s reaction always makes me jump, because I watched this exact gameplay, no flinches at all"
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgMqIlgXlyI&amp;t=7m08s"">7:08</a> I love how his jokes are getting more mature as we grow up 😂"
CoryxKenshin,"I know you won’t ever see this, but you be genuinely saved my life so many times. I cannot exaggerate this enough, you truly have changed so much for me. Even tonight you cheer me up, at least giving me the energy to continue living. Thank You so much cory."
CoryxKenshin,It’s surprising how many options you can take in this game like ignoring the doorbell before the flowers and you’ll be able to see the clever detail of Cara walk away from the door
CoryxKenshin,"Cory is like the cool Uncle at the Family gatherings. He doesn&#39;t show up often, but when he does. He always makes sure you have the best day of your life."
CoryxKenshin,The fact that Mr. Carson was kind enough to get him food and snacks while taking care of his house. Glad he wasn&#39;t a grumpy client.
CoryxKenshin,If Cory had realized that one of the names in the credits were called &quot;Dees Nuts&quot; then we would have a full 3 minutes of Cory laughing hysterically.
CoryxKenshin,Bro the fact that these are based/are true stories makes it 10x scarier. Bro that jumpscare got me so bad lmao
CoryxKenshin,the first jump scare made me go through the 20 stages of <b>e v e r y t h i n g</b>
CoryxKenshin,"Jumpscare at at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgMqIlgXlyI&amp;t=42m00s"">42:00</a> actually scared me for the first time in a long time, almost broke my headphones man ☠"
CoryxKenshin,only cory can make an hour long vid feel like 10 minutes
CoryxKenshin,"The fact how when the game ended he looked so happy, left a smile on my face."
CoryxKenshin,Cory I’ve been watching for about 8 years and you’ve helped me through some really tough times. Thank you for always having some good humor and vibes to cheer me up through everything.
CoryxKenshin,Hey Cory! I just wanted to say thank you. My mom has to go to work out of state and I’m sitting here crying because I miss her. But you are my comfort person because your so funny and make me smile with ease. Thank you for everything that you do and I genuinely love and thank you so much.
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgMqIlgXlyI&amp;t=9m01s"">9:01</a> I love ho Cory closes the seat and lid on the toilet, then doesn&#39;t flush, and proceeds to wonder why he can&#39;t wash his hands🤣"
CoryxKenshin,that jumpscare shook me to the core i have NEVER shaken like that from a jumpscare 😭 my whole body seized up for a second
CoryxKenshin,Corey is so real for recognizing Berleezy&#39;s voice as Jeffery
CoryxKenshin,"that jump scare at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgMqIlgXlyI&amp;t=42m35s"">42:35</a> only made my heart rate go up by 20"
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgMqIlgXlyI&amp;t=47m26s"">47:26</a> bro I’ve seen Cory paranoid before but by far this is the worst/funniest reaction I’ve ever seen from him😂😂😂😂😂 my boy really thought his life was over. Welcome to the game ptsd is still present😂😂"
CoryxKenshin,I hate creepy things but Cory makes it a better experience for me to watch
CoryxKenshin,That jumpscare was so devious it had me sitting there with Cory rethinking my entire life
CoryxKenshin,nothing better to do while you have ice coffee <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>wait watching cory the best
CoryxKenshin,“Inconsistent but well put together” the best way to represent Cory’s channel. And I freaking love it
CoryxKenshin,"Bro you helped me thru so much, my dad was in surgery and I was crying but then I started watching your video’s and everything went away. Thank you bro"
CoryxKenshin,Bro the part when Cory said Sucka ate 3 gatorades had me laughing for minutes😂
CoryxKenshin,The first jump scare me my soul fly up to heaven. I was laughing so hard when you reacted to it.😂😂😂😂
CoryxKenshin,"Cory&#39;s screams are more terrifying than a jumpscare, whenever he screams knowing somethings behind him scares me so bad without even thinking he&#39;s going 2 😭"
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgMqIlgXlyI&amp;t=47m43s"">47:43</a> Cory totally misses the girl walking by the window and the front door. Knowing he didn&#39;t see makes me even more scared for him lol"
CoryxKenshin,Him checking through the cameras screaming to get up is giving scrutinized vibes 💀
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgMqIlgXlyI&amp;t=15m27s"">15:27</a> went from laughing to screaming in a matter of seconds 😂"
CoryxKenshin,That jumpscare literally almost made me jump out of bed lol
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgMqIlgXlyI&amp;t=7m11s"">7:11</a> &quot;Im a little wet. Its not the first time ive heard that&quot; i love cory and his adult jokes"
CoryxKenshin,Let&#39;s congratulate Cory for his hard work
CoryxKenshin,This caused so much anxiety and stress OML but it was like a movie for me I LOVE YOU SM BRO!!!!
CoryxKenshin,Cory’s screams are more scary than the jump scares 😭
CoryxKenshin,Respect to the guy who experienced this in real life
CoryxKenshin,&quot;Switch the Color&quot; by CoryxKenshin has surpassed Samurai level in Samurai history.

CoryxKenshin,"If anyone needs context about the ending: when Rachel dropped her purse, she mentioned that her keys were in there. The ripper took her purse and at the end got inside her house to kill her. How we know this is that the noise you hear at the end can be heard when the ripper is chasing you sometimes"
CoryxKenshin,"&quot;Do you want a ride home?&quot;<br>&quot;No, it&#39;s OK - I know a safe way through the crack den and across the slums&quot;"
CoryxKenshin,coryxkenshin at this point is my only hope of happiness

But I have one thing left to say.<br><br>You were always the greatest at making minecraft&#39;s servers even more interesting, from skyblock to the Dream SMP, you were always the greatest. I salute you, techno. May you rest in peace, you legend you."

Technoblade,no matter how much time it has been i will always come back to re watch these videos. Technoblade never dies
Technoblade,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2mwbXInQCI&amp;t=4m08s"">4:08</a> It actually makes sense. It’s a pig hierarchy. Techno is a fully sentient, high functioning pig, the pig minions are basic functioning while normal pigs are death fodder for progression."
Technoblade,I can never watch his videos with the same smile again each time remembering our legend has passed away. RIP my guy you will be missed
Technoblade,Techno really knows his history.
Technoblade,This was one of the best videos he made wish he was here to make more and make more people happy and laughing and having fun. Minecraft was so fun when he was still here. He would love how the community has grown if he came back.
Technoblade,We will miss him may he rest in peace
Technoblade,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2mwbXInQCI&amp;t=7m05s"">7:05</a> will always be my favourite technoblade moment 😂"

Technoblade,"Someone tried to justify the snowman kit by saying, and I quote, <b>AND I QUOTE</b> &quot;It&#39;s easy to kill your own snowman.&quot; YEA THAT MAKES UP FOR IT"
Technoblade,hi lionrexx
Technoblade,When ever I play skywars I always tab to make sure Technoblade isn&#39;t in my game XD. Really hopping I&#39;ll eventually play one with him.
Technoblade,I am from the futer
Technoblade,on overfall you should go down to below on the first platform because sole times there&#39;s a chest there.
Technoblade,o7
Technoblade,"In the first <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeE38N9Oiqs&amp;t=2m31s"">2:31</a> mins of the video you got 7 kills impressive"

Technoblade,Yaay! I think this isn&#39;t a stupid april fools video! I think! Yay! A proper video for today! Yes!
Technoblade,You should do an episode of blitz combined with SKYWARS I think it would be cool
Technoblade,&quot;ARE YOU RECORDING TechnoBlade?&quot; Lmfao
Technoblade,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeE38N9Oiqs&amp;t=12m27s"">12:27</a> fall damage is usually calculated by (number of blocks fallen) - 3 = damage taken<br>jumping sends you slightly higher than 1 block in the air - about 1.2 iirc<br>so when you fell with a jump, there was .2 left over, whereas walking off didn&#39;t do anything (exactly 0)<br><br>and i think it has to do with the anticheat too, in normal MC i don&#39;t think this happens"
Technoblade,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeE38N9Oiqs&amp;t=12m48s"">12:48</a><br>I&#39;m sure like a million people already said it, but apparently it&#39;s to prevent people from bhopping, since it will eventually kill them<br>Getting an anticheat &lt; Lowering gameplay quality in order to avoid the problem"
Technoblade,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeE38N9Oiqs&amp;t=8m37s"">8:37</a> anyone else liked how the guy in chat took his time to spell &quot;techno blade&quot; wrong instead of typing Te and pressing tab to spell &quot;Technoblade&quot; correctly?"
Technoblade,"Did anyone else notice that as the matches progressed, the amount of kills he got decreased by one?"
Technoblade,I don&#39;t understand why people call hacks on a Youtuber. ITS A FRIKIN YOUTUBER!!!!
Technoblade,Techno if you combine 2 knock back X slimeballs you get kb 20.  Trust me on this.
Technoblade,"I still get rubberbaned a ton on skywars, and sometimes o teleport back up after falling and take the fall damage twice."
Technoblade,Are you recording?<br>omfg I&#39;m asking him this next time I see him
Technoblade,techno how did you get so good at pvp I need to know plz &lt;3

Technoblade,How does he have strength after every kill he gets?
Technoblade,"<a href=""http://youtu.be/DeE38N9Oiqs?t=0m50s"">0:50</a><br>I did nazi that coming"

Youtuber,Comments
TommyInnit,publishing this on my birthday so really hoping i will get more likes
TommyInnit,She scares me
TommyInnit,How we see Drista: <b>Dream’s sister</b><br>How the SMP members see Drista: <b>Free Illegal Items</b>
TommyInnit,Drista: “what did I do to get in prison”<br><br>TommyInnit: <b>Intense flashbacks come back</b>
TommyInnit,"Did you notice how Drista and Dream talk similarly? They both emphasize the first word they say when explaining something, and they stop randomly mid-sentence before continuing. It’s so funny to see just how much the people around you can have an effect on yourself! :)"
TommyInnit,the silence and then just “wHATTT GET OUT OF MY CHAIR” coming out of nowhere kills me everytime
TommyInnit,I love how her personality meshes perfectly with everyone else. Shes like the stereotype little* sister but she&#39;s also a bro. 💀 Kills me
TommyInnit,HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOMMYINNIT
TommyInnit,"&quot;I&#39;m not a 14 year old girl, I don&#39;t want corpse.&quot;<br>that line killed me"
TommyInnit,&quot;Did George leave you on read for the 8th time?&quot;<br>Heatwaves intensifies
TommyInnit,"“This is my friend Drista, she doesn’t smoke.” Best introduction ever 🤣"
TommyInnit,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u8y7o6JMQY&amp;t=2m59s"">2:59</a> oh no dream is here<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u8y7o6JMQY&amp;t=15m03s"">15:03</a> big bro dream supervising everyone and everyone<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u8y7o6JMQY&amp;t=15m24s"">15:24</a> oh no he has lost 1/3 gremlins<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u8y7o6JMQY&amp;t=16m38s"">16:38</a> FACTS<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u8y7o6JMQY&amp;t=17m40s"">17:40</a> why does Ranboo sound like an AI monotone robo-jumbo<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u8y7o6JMQY&amp;t=18m22s"">18:22</a> honestly i think the best part of Drista streams is having Dream confused every two seconds cause he can&#39;t hear them plot diabolical plans<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u8y7o6JMQY&amp;t=19m19s"">19:19</a> <i>meanwhile in worldza</i><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u8y7o6JMQY&amp;t=21m05s"">21:05</a> philza be loosing it😂"
TommyInnit,tommy: me and drista are best friends<br><br>drista: BAN
TommyInnit,These two will be the new Ant &amp; Dec... I can see it happening.
TommyInnit,Dream: don’t do anything stupid<br>Tommy: * joins a game with Drista who has the ability to do whatever she wants without Dream’s supervision *
TommyInnit,I love how tommy is so nice in his intros but in his videos he&#39;s just so chaotic 💀🧍‍♀️
TommyInnit,Drishta calmly destroying all of Dream’s hard work for the past few months
TommyInnit,dream sounds like an exhausted dad that&#39;s supervising the 3 kids
TommyInnit,"Sometimes Tommy&#39;s videos just make me laugh even with drista joins the game, cause  it even funnier when drista plays with Tommy In the DSMP"
TommyInnit,"Every time Dream does the &quot;tired older brother&quot; voice I relate to him on a spiritual level<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u8y7o6JMQY&amp;t=2m53s"">2:53</a><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u8y7o6JMQY&amp;t=15m00s"">15:00</a>"
TommyInnit,Drista: <b>*spawns ender dragon*</b><br>Ranboo: AHHHHHHHH <b>*Runs away*</b><br>Ender dragon: why are you running away from auntie?
TommyInnit,"I love the Tommy and Drista content. It´s like Tommy is going to Dream and asks if Drista can come out to play with him. And Dream is superviving them through a window. XD XD <br>And they invited the neighbor kid Ranboo to join this time, so they can be even more chaotic. XD<br><br>Also:<br>Tommy: What´s a good code word for prison?<br>Ranboo: JAIL! Wait, maybe not.<br>XD"
TommyInnit,Now I can visualize dreams face while he’s yelling at tommy
TommyInnit,&quot;Has George left you on read for the eight time?&quot; Had me rolling on the floor laughing
TommyInnit,"Tommy: &quot;she dosnt smoke&quot;,<br>Ranboo: &quot;I would assume so&quot;.<br>😂😂"
TommyInnit,The fact that Phil wasn&#39;t surprised about Tommy being in spectator mode is probably the best part.
TommyInnit,"Tommy: yeah I’ll take care!<br>Drista: <b>disobeying all rules of the role play, lore and storys</b>"
TommyInnit,Tommy: causally adding Ranboo to vc early in the stream<br>Ranboo: stays the rest of the time
TommyInnit,I like the fact that when dream came back and didnt say anything about the floating invisible island they were standing on
TommyInnit,Lets all appreciate how much time he spends and tries his best to make us happy!
TommyInnit,ive watched this series so many times but it never gets boring
TommyInnit,dream is literally the older brother monitoring a group of teens and I&#39;m Dead 💀
TommyInnit,Tommy making fun of American accents is everything to me
TommyInnit,Tommy:”what does that sign say?” <br>Drista:”AHH-“<br>That was the funniest thing I’ve ever heard 😂
TommyInnit,I was told a while back that I was like a female version of tommyinnit. Now that I&#39;ve FINALLY checked him out. I can confirm lmao
TommyInnit,Ranboo: skeptical of dream’s sister being with Tommy<br><br>Dream’s sister: gives them both 9999999 levels of xp<br><br>Ranboo: AH HECK YEA YOU CANCSTAY AS LONG AS YOU WANT
TommyInnit,Phillza’s laugh just make everything 1000 Times funnier
TommyInnit,tommy: <b>has a panic attack every time he takes damage</b><br>drista: <b>falls off a mountain</b> &quot;i can deal with pain tommy&quot;
TommyInnit,Drista:*gives him seeds*<br>Tommy: wtf?<br>Drista:*gives him gold and diamonds*<br>Tommy:it&#39;s fine-
TommyInnit,Lets take the moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into his content for us.Good job
TommyInnit,"officially 2 years since Drista, WE NEED THIS DUO BACK PLEASE"
TommyInnit,&quot;Do you think I&#39;m some 14 y/o girl on twitter? <br>No I dont want corpse&quot; <br>I CANT WHY IS THAT SO TRUE
TommyInnit,Dam it’s been an year....<br>I genuinely really do miss this duo
TommyInnit,"drista is always so chaotic, you can’t help but laugh when she shows up lmao"

Just a fair warning."
TommyInnit,Can we just appreciate the fact that this video is EXACTLY 10 minutes long.

TommyInnit,imagine him knowing he would be one of the biggest streamers worldwide in a few months :D
TommyInnit,I can imagine Tommy just falling out of bed and crawling to his desk just to see if he finally has the Youtube rank.
TommyInnit,Little did everyone know what a legend this manchild would become
TommyInnit,"Let&#39;s be real - who came here just to watch his historic, epic intro?"
TommyInnit,I still unironically enjoy that intro. it gives off such chad vibes
TommyInnit,Every time I come back to watch the intro I smile
TommyInnit,I thought i would never see Tommy dance to a song that says “and i get more - than a toilet seat” <br>—Wilbur Soot
TommyInnit,man his dancing is soo weirdly addicting to watch
TommyInnit,"Insane to see how far it&#39;s come since the Hypixel days, anyone else come back here sometimes to see how far Tommy has come in the space of just over 2 years?"
TommyInnit,Petition for Tommy to get the [Trusty] rank
TommyInnit,When he said “this is for the egirls” I just about cried
TommyInnit,sometimes i wonder if tommy knows what the song he&#39;s dancing to is saying
TommyInnit,I&#39;d be very interested to see this vid&#39;s audience retention to see how much more watch time the intro got than the actual video
TommyInnit,He went from getting High from a Pixel to being SMPed in a Dream
TommyInnit,The thing is.. Tommy was only 16 or 15. I think this was very very enjoyable for him. Lets appreciate that we have the tommy we have now :D
TommyInnit,Imagine the peoples reaction of a random dude dancing in a basketball court wearing mlg glasses..
TommyInnit,"Timedeo has been here since the beginning , he is a legend."
TommyInnit,We gotta appreciate that people didn’t just start hating after he did that dab.
TommyInnit,"The best era of tommy, before and just after"

TommyInnit,Can we all admire tommy for drawing a &quot;special&quot; thing as soon as he gets yt rank
TommyInnit,Watching a child dance in a basketball court with mlg glasses is <b>noice</b>
TommyInnit,Can we still appreciate the incredible intro in 2021?

TommyInnit,The face tracking as he walks backwards with the sunglasses and his goofy smile- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
TommyInnit,His voice sounds so different wtf<br><br>That’s so crazy it’s like when time goes by your voice changes I’m shocked
TommyInnit,I love how tommy is dancing to a song that says:<br>“I smoke so much weed<br>You wouldn’t believe”
TommyInnit,"For those of you that have been here since the beginning, this video hits different. No hate if you’re newer to this channel, but for you originals outs there... you guys are awesome"
TommyInnit,I have to admit that the intro is one of the best in my humble opinion
TommyInnit,i regularly come to this video just to watch the first 15 seconds because of how satisfying it is. never fails to bring up my mood
TommyInnit,Tommy is a master artist 🤣
TommyInnit,This feels like it was made 10 years ago.
TommyInnit,"tommy sounds so happy in this, its just so adorable how happy he is when he says “i got the youtube rank!”"
TommyInnit,Congrats dude. Well deserved! Your a great content creator bro.

TommyInnit,Man i miss this shit. But i&#39;m happy for him. He grew so much
TommyInnit,Tommy is the kind of person to call being scammed receiving expensive lessons in business
TommyInnit,Tommy needs to find a mod pack to play with tubbo and badlinu and Rudy that has an extended “drugs” list
TommyInnit,Nobody:<br><br><br>Authoritys see every title on Tommy&#39;s video titles: Damn we got Al capone on our hands.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>All in favor we re-open alcatraz for Tommy.

TommyInnit,I love how Tommy used Giorno&#39;s Theme.
TommyInnit,Toommy must become a gangstar to rid the streets  of drugs
TommyInnit,Conclusion: Let Technoblade win
TommyInnit,"How to make a tommyinnit title+thumbnail:<br>Step 1: choose a subject, skyblock or smpEarth.<br>Step 2: if you chose skyblock start by using the words &quot;stealing&quot; or &quot;illegal.&quot; If you chose smpEarth use the words &quot;killing&quot; or &quot;trapping&quot; or &#39;burning&quot; or something like that.<br>Step 3: choose a popular item/ YouTuber. For example, Midas sword/ technoblade.<br><br>On to the thumbnail. Choose a skin or item, then blur and swirl the background. If you want some more spice, add a stream chat or mc chat with some YouTuber saying something. If it&#39;s a try not to laugh, the only acceptable thumbnail is Tommy with his hands somewhere on his face/ in the air.<br><br>If you did this all right, you should end up with something like &quot;The ILLEGAL Technoblade STEALING!&quot; And the thumbnail being a seizure of techno faces with a overflux orb chilling in the background."
TommyInnit,&#39;IM STREAMING TO 300 PEOPLE RIGHT&#39; not knowing that in 8 months hes gonna be streaming to 150k people
TommyInnit,"It wasn’t bitzel,  it was the man in the chicken costume"
TommyInnit,I feel like deo puts himself less in his thumbnails than tommy does
TommyInnit,"Here’s a quick tip,if your ever bored or watching YouTube just change your watch speed to .25 or x2 for a better and more entertaining video."
TommyInnit,Plot twist: Tommy was actually the one selling all the drugs
TommyInnit,I love the upload schedule
TommyInnit,From YouTube sensation to drug dealer smh fame changed tommy 😔
TommyInnit,this will be played inn elementary schools in the future for sure
TommyInnit,Didn&#39;t think Tommy would listen to the misfits podcast. hmmmmm
TommyInnit,Tommy are you ever gonna fix your island. It looks. Like something.
TommyInnit,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3og9tbv6krY&amp;t=1m54s"">1:54</a> tayber got banned for hacking, pigicial got banned for sharing dupe exploits"

TommyInnit,Tommy: you&#39;re not about to make a WHOLE video about drugs right?
TommyInnit,Tommy year ago:NO MORE DRUGS<br>Tommy now: DRUGSSSSS
TommyInnit,Remember when tommy gave crystal fragments to techno and tommy said himself it was a drug for techno so he is a drug dealer
TommyInnit,We need whips...<br>Me: they&#39;re probably in the children&#39;s closet.
TommyInnit,He just called 30% of us druggies lmao
TommyInnit,&quot;do you have drugs on you?&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>&quot;depends&quot;</b>
TommyInnit,I should have invested in green gold sooner before the crash...
TommyInnit,I love how as soon as Charlie and Wilbur are in a video together they start a literal cult together
TommyInnit,"I love how Wilbur was actually trying for the first part of the vid, got bored, and started yehawing with Charlie"
TommyInnit,"As someone from Idaho, the fact that Wilbur managed to pick one of the least geographically southern states and yet still pick one that fits the bit is honestly incredibly amusing"
TommyInnit,&quot;I cant die or else im dead!&quot; And &quot;Im dying to death&quot; Are probably the best Tommyinnit and Wilbur Soot quotes in all time
TommyInnit,"Wilbur: Speaks in a heavily stereotypical southern-american accent<br>Also Wilbur: &quot;We pronounce our t&#39;s, this isn&#39;t twitter&quot;"
TommyInnit,I love how Philza is only 9 years older than Wilbur and he acts Like he’s his grandpa.
TommyInnit,I actually felt sorry for Charlie when tommy and wil left the vc
TommyInnit,Wilbur: We pronounce our “t’s”<br>*not even five seconds later<br>Wilbur: And one of the important things you must know about <b>Bri’n</b>
TommyInnit,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFZ5EMTcehA&amp;t=13m33s"">13:33</a> Tommy sounded genuinely betrayed when he said &quot;Don&#39;t say it was you.&quot; And Wilbur&#39;s reaction a few seconds after looking like he didn&#39;t want to tell him was perfection."
TommyInnit,Charlie and Wilbur always go off into some kind of roleplay in every episode
TommyInnit,Wilbur always seems to have an entire personality change whenever he puts his glasses on
TommyInnit,Fun fact: this mod exists in real life! It’s called WW1 and can only be accessed in versions 19.14 - 19-18
TommyInnit,"As a stereotype southern person, I find this absolutely hilarious<br><br>And to answer all yals burning questions: yes everybody gets a tractor license with their birth certificate."
TommyInnit,I love how everyone else is just pure chaos and Phil is just trying to beat the game
TommyInnit,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFZ5EMTcehA&amp;t=12m56s"">12:56</a><br>&quot;If we were in the same womb, I would&#39;ve won.&quot; - Charlie 2021"
TommyInnit,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFZ5EMTcehA&amp;t=14m33s"">14:33</a> the fact that Charlie genuinely looks so sad hurts my heart"
TommyInnit,“I can’t die or else I’m dead”<br><br>Great observation Tommy.
TommyInnit,Wilbur&#39;s American accent is everything I&#39;ve ever needed
TommyInnit,I love how Wilbur “clocks out” before going off on his insanity RP
TommyInnit,I love Southern Wilbur. He would be a good Texas resident.
TommyInnit,Charlie and Wilbur are a classic comedy duo
TommyInnit,&quot;ITS EITHER DROWN OR DIE!!!&quot;<br>The words of a true mastermind.
TommyInnit,I love how Wilbur and Charlie are just memeing when Tommy and Phil are doing their best to beat the game
TommyInnit,Tommy: “ I can’t die or I’m dead.”<br><br><br>I didn’t realise we were dealing with a genius here
TommyInnit,Sometimes I genuinely forget that Wilbur is an adult… it just doesn’t feel right also I love how Charlie and Wilbur just have this elaborate story line
TommyInnit,Tommy: &quot;this is a God horse&quot;<br><br>Chat: &quot;philza hit the ground to hard&quot;
TommyInnit,I love how Wilbur says &quot;We pronounce our T&#39;s&quot; and then seconds later proceeds to say &quot;Bri&#39;ain&quot;
TommyInnit,"Phil’s face as Wilbur called him old is priceless<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFZ5EMTcehA&amp;t=1m49s"">1:49</a>"
TommyInnit,Wilbur and Charlie are always so funny 😭
TommyInnit,TommyInnit is the kind of guy that makes everyone&#39;s day
TommyInnit,Tommy’s best quote: “Phiiiiiiil you’ve drugged me”
TommyInnit,Wilbur: Im dying to death<br>&quot;Hmm... yes the floor here is made out of floor.&quot;
TommyInnit,"The fact that now, two year later Wilbur would consider himself old"
TommyInnit,When Tommy watched his recording  I wonder how he felt when Wilbur placed the block
TommyInnit,I love how Charlie and Wilbur always go off and do the most random crap
TommyInnit,"Literally every vid<br>Philza: actually plays the game<br>Tommy: screams laughs, and does stupid shit<br>Slimecicle: Does really weird shit<br>Wilbur: gets extremely and uncomfortably obsessed with something so pointless (or powerful)"
TommyInnit,“We don’ deal with green blobs like you”<br><br>Dream: “we live in a world…”
TommyInnit,I like it when philza and tommy just teaming and try to beat the game and charlie and will just wondering around being funny af
TommyInnit,I love how Philza always goes into the same pose anytime something bad happens.
TommyInnit,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFZ5EMTcehA&amp;t=8m42s"">8:42</a> Wilbur had a heavy Australian accent for a second there. When he said “there we go”"
TommyInnit,I like how Tommy just instantly trust Wilbur
TommyInnit,Let’s just have some respect for the people making the subtitles ✊
TommyInnit,I swear Phil gets SLAPPED with the <b>”your old”</b> Every video
TommyInnit,so funny that wilbur was genuinely being helpful then literally clocked out to do his cult shit
TommyInnit,"Pretty much every video. <br>Philza: actually trying. Being the dad.<br>Wilbur and Charlie: CULT<br>Tommy: Chaotic child, always laughing."
TommyInnit,"When Tommy first joined their call and they were speaking gibberish, that was the hardest I’ve laughed in a while XD. I loved it"
TommyInnit,Honestly I am glad Charlie and Wilbur always makes a cult
TommyInnit,I love how Wilbur blamed Charlie for killing Tommy
TommyInnit,"I’m sure Tommy won’t see this but, I really enjoy watching his videos. Just the screaming all the time and chaos make me laugh every time because I can relate to it somehow because of my friend group. Thank you Tommy for being the funniest YouTuber I know! ^^"
TommyInnit,We all miss technoblade. But Legends never die.
TommyInnit,"took awhile to build up the courage to watch. cant imagine how much it took to make, edit, and post. Rest in peace Techno, your legacy will never die. 👑"
TommyInnit,"i can’t even imagine how tommy feels , especially at such a young age losing an idol that you’ve finally become friends with.. rip technoblade"
TommyInnit,its been over a year since he passed away but i still shed a tear every time i hear about his passing he was a true legend we wont forget.
TommyInnit,i genuinely cried at the end. seeing how much tommy looked up to him is inspiring. Techno blade never dies.😥😥😥
TommyInnit,i genuinely cried at the end. seeing how much tommy looked up to him is inspiring. Techno blade never dies.
TommyInnit,"I’m grateful we have these moments to look back on, no matter what happened, we can always go back and relive the years we had with him"
TommyInnit,"It hasn&#39;t been a year without Technoblade, because Techno will never truly be gone. He&#39;ll live on in the merch so many of us wear, the videos we chuckle fondly to, and the dreams and inspirations he&#39;s given so many of us. Thank you Tommy for making this.<br><br>TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES"
TommyInnit,"It took me 2 weeks to build the courage to just watch this video.<br>It&#39;s honnestly hard to still process this, Techno has been my idol for years like for many people, and with how much it hurts someone like me that never even saw him in a game, nor talked with him. <br>I can&#39;t imagine how hard it is for his close friends like you Tommy, I hope you and Technoblade&#39;s other close friends an relatives are doing good, we all miss him so much"
TommyInnit,As soon as the clips were over and tommy began giving his speech I couldn’t stop crying. Rest in peace technoblade
TommyInnit,"We&#39;ll never forget the many times Techno cheered us up when we were sad, inspired us with his stories, and made us happy with his gameplay. You&#39;ll never be forgotten, King 👑🙏"
TommyInnit,I don&#39;t think there will ever be a day were the line &quot;Technoblade never dies&quot; doesn&#39;t make me tear up.
TommyInnit,"Thank you for everything, Technoblade. His legacy lives on forever."
TommyInnit,"It’s so cute seeing all his old memories together , they really were a dynamic duo ( RIP techno ❤️ ) Technoblade , never dies 🕊️"
TommyInnit,"“We never knew we were making memories, we thought we were just having fun” -Winnie The Pooh<br><br>After Technoblades death, this quote hit harder than anything else<br><br>Thank you, Tommy"
TommyInnit,We will always look back on the moments with him.
TommyInnit,"I started crying halfway through. Rest in power, Techno. 🕊️"
TommyInnit,Techno&#39;s legacy he left behind will never end. RIP King.
TommyInnit,"We all miss him. He really is one of the greatest, a huge inspiration for many including myself. Technoblade never dies."
TommyInnit,"This made me ball my eyes out. I remember all those memories and streams. Those were the days, we didn’t think much of it then, but now looking back it was a huge part of our life. I loved watching you guys. <br>After losing someone just over a year ago, I haven’t been the same since, and comprehending this isn’t easy. I understand the pain, and seeing you hurt hurts me, because I found comfort in you guys, and now we both and many more have to figure out a way to grieve and love the memory of another. <br>(Ps I understand the small things are the heaviest.. I truly feel that). <br>Technoblade will never die, we love you."
TommyInnit,Techno was an inspiration to everyone. For me it was his go getting attitude that helped me push through the depressing covid times. I&#39;m glad i got to watch one of the best people in the world give everything to his friends and his community. RIP Technoblade
TommyInnit,"Rip techno, a legend like him will never die"
TommyInnit,"its hard to think that my childhood hero is gone, his videos helped me through the hardest of times, thank you for everything, techno."
TommyInnit,"Tommy really suffered the worst to his loss, I can’t even imagine meeting your idol, the person he looked up to the most and became best friends with pass away. That must have been intolerable pain, he will always be loved and techno blade never dies!"
TommyInnit,Thank you for always keeping a smile on everyone’s faces Technoblade ❤️
TommyInnit,"I cant believe its been a year already.... I miss watching him so much, waiting for months for an upload just to have it be one of the best videos i&#39;d seen in a while. I havent cried about his death since the week after i saw the video with his dad and this just brought it all back. Thank you for this Tommy, I needed something like this"
TommyInnit,The &quot;I miss you&quot; with the music makes it perfect. Technoblade will never be forgotten. Rest In Piece
TommyInnit,"He would be SO proud of you and what you accomplished! This past year was SO hard for me without him making videos that made my days better and now you, your videos and streams make me feel better on rough days so thank you for still being here! And,<br>Technoblade never dies!"
TommyInnit,If I could turn back time a million times I would never change the part where I started watching dsmp content. Seeing Technoblade grow as a content creator and a person has been such a beautiful thing to me and I will always hold on to that. Thank you Techno. Thank you Tommy. Techno will always live on in our hearts. Technoblade never dies❤
TommyInnit,"it took me a really long time to build up to watching techno, but ever since i got over that hurdle i&#39;ve been watching his videos and streams just like before. tommy, it took me so long to watch this video because it hurts to think i&#39;ll never get to see a new stream pop up... thank you for being vulnerable with us. technoblade never dies!"
TommyInnit,What an INCREDIBLE TRIBUTE! Goosebumps. RIP to a true legend 💙
TommyInnit,"Techno was my... Inspiration, I cry when I see this, and just keep looking at his stuff. Rest in peace"
TommyInnit,"Jesus i can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been a year already ... i remember getting  shocked by the news that morning and cried. it felt so weird, because i rarely watch his videos, but i guess whenever i do, the way he was had always made me feel accompanied. I wouldn&#39;t even call myself an actual fan, but somehow his passing just hit me hard, felt like losing a very very distant friend..."
TommyInnit,"SBI feels so uncomplete without techno, but his legacy lives on forever.❤"
TommyInnit,I&#39;ve never seen tommy this serious ever before. 😢
TommyInnit,"Seeing tommy&#39;s eyes get progressively filled with tears is heartbreaking, he met his hero and became friends with him and now he&#39;s gone. It&#39;s hard to realize he isn&#39;t going to come back, you feel like it&#39;s a dream and when you wake up you will see a notification from him. But sadly, this isn&#39;t a dream"
TommyInnit,"Man, I never watched him as much as I wanted to, what an absolute legend"
TommyInnit,"seeing tommy cry was really something else. we all miss techno like crazy, but we have to accept the reality… technoblade never dies in our hearts"
TommyInnit,"I’ve never, ever watched any of the dream smp videos but all I would see or hear in my head when I was sad was “techno blade never dies!” And when I found out a year ago that he passed I broke down, I don’t think he realized what an effect he had on the world. Thinking about it brings me to tears every time."
TommyInnit,"If Techno, in whatever afterlife he’s in, ever sees how many people he has crying for him, he’d cackle ❤"
TommyInnit,"We will all miss techno. No matter how long it is, no one will forget."
TommyInnit,"A man doesn&#39;t die when his heart stops beating he, dies when he&#39;s forgotten...<br>Rest in peace technoblade, your memory will live on forever"
TommyInnit,"I started sobbing watching this. I remember his goodbye video that his dad posted and that was such a hard video for me to watch. I cant even imagine how you must feel Tommy. But im so glad that we have all these memories to keep. Stay strong Tommy, we love you &lt;3"
TommyInnit,The pain this mad must feel. Rip Techno. We love you Tommy stay strong ❤
TommyInnit,"seeing a funny man cry can make anyone tear up, REST IN POWER, TECHNOBLADE"
TommyInnit,"I feel ya man. Even though I never met him, just by watching his videos he felt like a close friend. His passing was the fricking worst. When things do start to get tough though, you just gotta pray about it. Thx for this video Tommy."
TommyInnit,"I’m not in the fan base as much anymore, but I still can’t believe it’s been a year. Such a nice tribute and were all proud of you Tom."
TommyInnit,Thank you Tommy for being honest and open but you deserve to be happy as well. Technoblade never dies
TommyInnit,Rest in peace Technoblade. Your memories will never be forgotten! Those will always remain with us forever.
TommyInnit,"I didn’t know of Technoblade until after his passing, but looking back at his videos and seeing how much the community loved him and how impactful his death was for a lot of people, I see why he was so beloved. He was a great kid. I can truly say, Technoblade never dies"

GeorgeNotFound,Dream when he sees a phantom: <b>RUN</b><br><br>Dream when he sees the enderdragon:<br><br>I can kill this guy in less than 2 minutes
GeorgeNotFound,"George: &quot;I have no food!&quot;<br>Cakes: <i>&quot;Oh baby, this is just an illusion&quot;</i>"
GeorgeNotFound,"It’s so cute that whenever Dream is in danger, George shouts “Dream!” And then Dream replies with “George!”<br>😭"
GeorgeNotFound,I love how dream is 21 and sounds 27 and George is 23 and sounds and looks 14<br>(Mommy I&#39;m famous)
GeorgeNotFound,literally one minute in and it already looks like a yard sale
GeorgeNotFound,"Dream: jumps into lava and while airborne, switches his inventory and drinks fire resistance, baiting and escaping from 3 hunters                                                                                Also Dream: <b>sees George jumped off a cliff, looking back at him</b> “are you still alive”"
GeorgeNotFound,the cut offs between George’s screams r killing me 😭
GeorgeNotFound,George when faced with a mob that’s dangerous:<br>“ <b>DREam! DREEEAAM!! dream!!</b> “
GeorgeNotFound,Dream : &quot;We&#39;re out of food!&quot;<br><br>George : &quot;There&#39;s no food anywhere in sight!&quot;<br><br>20 cakes on the ground : &quot;Am I invisible to you?&quot;
GeorgeNotFound,Are we not gonna ignore how nice dream is in these kind of vids.He always stops killing the en<br>der dragon when it’s low so George gets the achievement.
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9qngCgy74g&amp;t=8m02s"">8:02</a> George: &quot;OH, THERE&#39;S A DIAMOND BLOCK. Don&#39;t look over here.&quot; as Dream casually gets one himself and turns it into a leaf"
GeorgeNotFound,"George: &quot;Dream! Theres a diamond block here, DON&#39;T LOOK!&quot;<br><br>Dream: <b>&quot;WhErE&quot;</b> deletes the diamond over and over again"
GeorgeNotFound,George’s secret move is a<br>“Dream Help help help I’m about to die”
GeorgeNotFound,Just realized how colorful this was and George wouldn&#39;t actually be able to see all these colors :&#39;(
GeorgeNotFound,George: <b>about to jump in the portal</b><br>Dream:&quot;can we go in together?&quot;<br><b>George gets the end achievement</b>

GeorgeNotFound,Alternative title: George saving Dream from lava  and fire for 23 minutes and 11 seconds
GeorgeNotFound,George: we need food<br>Also George: looks at hay bales and pig spawner.
GeorgeNotFound,Even when GeorgeNotFound kills the Ender Dragon he&#39;s still eating
GeorgeNotFound,George : DREAM STOP LOOKING EVERYWHERE!<br>Dream: Looks everywhere possible.
GeorgeNotFound,George: &quot;Don&#39;t look over here&quot;<br>Dream: &quot;Where?&quot;<br><b>block changes</b>
GeorgeNotFound,I can imagine:<br><br>(Dream&#39;s sister come to his room to ask for something)<br><b>Dream looks at her</b><br>Dream&#39;s sister turns into a coral block

GeorgeNotFound,Tell me you have trust issues without telling me you have trust issues:<br>George: dream Im literally almost dead<br>Dream: actually?
GeorgeNotFound,"This locked hard to do, but it was a competition for both of you and it was pretty funny to watch. Amazing video and keep up the good work.<br>You guys are awesome thank you so much for bringing joy on those sad days."
GeorgeNotFound,Imagine being the mobs and just seeing these two humanoids run through your home changing all of the terrain around you into a mishmash of different meterials
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9qngCgy74g&amp;t=11m32s"">11:32</a><br>&quot;I have ten Emaralds!&quot;<br>&quot;WUATT?&quot;<br>&quot;Uh, I have ten Ender Pearls&quot;<br>I m dead 😂"

GeorgeNotFound,Dream: &#39;Oh there&#39;s a village!&#39;<br>Dream and George in their heads: &#39;I&#39;m about to end the man&#39;s whole career!&#39;
GeorgeNotFound,WHENEVER DREAM IS DYING GEORGE HAS TO YELL DREAM AND HE’LL RESPOND WITH GEORGE 💀 I LOVE THESE TWO
GeorgeNotFound,Them: we don&#39;t have food!<br><br>Me: <b>intensely stares at the cake blocks</b>
GeorgeNotFound,George: &quot;There is water in the nether&quot;<br>Cauldron with Water: <b>*did someone called me?*</b>
GeorgeNotFound,"This is the most colorful challenge ever , sadly George can&#39;t see it"
GeorgeNotFound,Dream: Uses his fire resistance potion<br><br><br>George: <b>our potion</b>
GeorgeNotFound,Dream when hunting- “silently sneaking…”<br><br><br>George when hunting- “Screams like a banshee”
GeorgeNotFound,Dream: “George did you find a shipwreck?”<br>George: (play dumb)<br>George: “what’s a shipwreck?”<br>George: (not that dumb)
GeorgeNotFound,I love how dream just gets progressively more and more psychotic throught the hunting videos. It doesn&#39;t matter if he&#39;s hunting or speed running he always gets progressively more psychotic and its amazing.
GeorgeNotFound,I just realized how many times you can actually see Dream sneaking up on George but George never sees him because he blends in with the nether colors to him
GeorgeNotFound,I love how delayed Dream&#39;s reaction to George attacking him is.
GeorgeNotFound,"dream in his manhunts: normally calm, collected,  quiet when being chased, smart, used game mechanics to his advantage. dream when he’s chasing george: a complete psychopath"
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_1jjxwaMxg&amp;t=7m06s"">7:06</a> <b>Here we encounter a rare George giving Dream his angelic mating call</b>"
GeorgeNotFound,Can we just appreciate how good george is at Minecraft he survived for a long time
GeorgeNotFound,George crafting the iron ingot and the shield without closing the inventory to avoid getting the iron achievement is a big IQ play. I didn&#39;t even know that worked like that.
GeorgeNotFound,"George:  Attacks Dream, &quot;AAAAAAHAAAHAAHAA&quot;<br>Dream:   &quot;That scared me!&quot;<br>Me:   &quot;My ears are no longer.&quot;"
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_1jjxwaMxg&amp;t=6m00s"">6:00</a> and this friends is why we have learned to never wear headphones while watching George"
GeorgeNotFound,Dream’s Ability : His Intelligence<br>George’s Ability: Deafen People
GeorgeNotFound,"Dream: <b>”No where to run, no where to hide! YOUR A DEADMAN WALKING!”</b><br><br>George: “Sapnap come pick me up I’m scared.”"
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_1jjxwaMxg&amp;t=7m05s"">7:05</a> Here we see George in his natural habitat. Watch as he defends his territory with a war cry almost imitating a mountain lion."
GeorgeNotFound,"I like how George does subpar when he’s an hunter, but when he is the speedrunner he actually does good."
GeorgeNotFound,george’s scream before killing dream has me in TEARS that was so unexpected
GeorgeNotFound,"I think one of Georges&#39;s biggest weaknesses in those is that he underestimates himself. Like, he had a shield and a sword, he would most likely win if he tried taking on a guy with nothing but sticks to his name. But by running, he&#39;s wasting pearls, food and making himself vulnerable by panicking 🤔"
GeorgeNotFound,Minor inconvenience: exists<br>George: <b>screams like someone is skinning him alive</b>
GeorgeNotFound,Me watching Dream’s POVs: YES GET HIM<br>Me watching George’s POVs: HOLY CRAP RUN LIKE HECK FROM THAT PSYCHOPATH GEORGE
GeorgeNotFound,"*dream throwing himself to lava<br>George: &quot;NOOO!!&quot;<br>Dream : &quot;YESSS!!&quot;<br>It&#39;s evolving, just backwards."
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_1jjxwaMxg&amp;t=6m02s"">6:02</a>  ,  Here we see a George in his natural habitat, hunting his prey, the Georges tactic has never failed him yet"
GeorgeNotFound,Dream: <b>calmly kills animal</b><br><br>George: <b>DEMON SCREACH</b>
GeorgeNotFound,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_1jjxwaMxg&amp;t=15m50s"">15:50</a> Dream makes a few of the biggest mistames of his life: Hitting George, which helps him get onto a safe block, and then JUMPING AFTER HIM which just amazed me."
GeorgeNotFound,George&#39;s warcry: actually terrifying<br><br>Dream: <b>Ooga Booga</b>
GeorgeNotFound,George: Finally. I escaped Dream and now I’m safe.<br><br>Wither Skeleton: <b>Are you sure about that?</b>
GeorgeNotFound,"“Diamonds for sale! Get your... fresh... steamy... hot... diamonds!”<br>-Dream, 2020"
GeorgeNotFound,"everyso often I come back just for the end to hear Dream be utterly unhinged, never fails to make me laugh a lung out"
GeorgeNotFound,I love how dream over analyses everything even Gorege going “boom boom boom”
GeorgeNotFound,"I&#39;ve been watching a whole lot of Manhunts, so when George first snuck up on Dream in the nether, I was laughing my head off thinking: Oh now, isn&#39;t that familiar? Except this time George finally isn&#39;t the one screaming."
GeorgeNotFound,george out here using all of dream’s tricks he learned from previous episodes
GeorgeNotFound,"The entire media: &quot;Omg how did you kill <b>DREAM</b> George?!&quot;<br>George: The secret ingredient, is scream"
GeorgeNotFound,"It would&#39;ve funny if Dream said, &quot;It&#39;s over George! I have the high ground.&quot; and George said, &quot;You underestimate my power!&quot; at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_1jjxwaMxg&amp;t=19m13s"">19:13</a>"
GeorgeNotFound,Remember: Dream speedrunning a manhunt is like a high-stakes challenge video.<br>George speedrunning a manhunt is a <i>survival horror</i>
GeorgeNotFound,Dream sounds absolutely deranged in that last minute. It&#39;s amazing.
GeorgeNotFound,"I think, aside from a few mistakes, George definitely did himself proud here."
GeorgeNotFound,i kept wondering how george missed dream&#39;s bright green self so often and then i remembered oh yeah this man is severely colourblind
GeorgeNotFound,"other people:&quot;getting an advancement is nice right?&quot;<br>dream team:&quot;aactually,&quot;"
GeorgeNotFound,George: screams like a 5 year old<br>Dream: that was a warcry
GeorgeNotFound,Dream&#39;s taunting at the end was perfection
GeorgeNotFound,I wouldn’t be suprised if George had gotten the cops called on him for a noise complaint for screaming so loud
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_1jjxwaMxg&amp;t=15m39s"">15:39</a><br>Dream: You made a huge mistake!<br><br>George: You really think I did?"
GeorgeNotFound,How to beat Dream: Just scream before attacking
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_1jjxwaMxg&amp;t=20m40s"">20:40</a><br>I love how he&#39;s encouraging himself."
GeorgeNotFound,You have to respect dream for giving George props because of the block trap instead of raging.
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_1jjxwaMxg&amp;t=15m18s"">15:18</a> I love how George is just blabing about stuff and Dream is just sittin&#39; there under the trees<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_1jjxwaMxg&amp;t=6m03s"">6:03</a> I love the way George screamed at Dream"
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_1jjxwaMxg&amp;t=13m17s"">13:17</a> Dream&#39;s laugh sounded cute yet scary at the same time"
GeorgeNotFound,I really enjoy watching the whole manhunt playlist you made. Every video was entertaining!
GeorgeNotFound,Can we just appreciate how much better George has gotten at Minecraft
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_1jjxwaMxg&amp;t=7m05s"">7:05</a> George´s battlescream is hilarious"
GeorgeNotFound,"Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoy the video!<br>Download Monster Legends now and get The Dream Team monster collection until August 10th! <br><a href=""https://monsterlegends.onelink.me/X4Sc/MrNotFound"">https://monsterlegends.onelink.me/X4Sc/MrNotFound</a>"
GeorgeNotFound,Alternative title: George protecting his friends from their fans
GeorgeNotFound,Let&#39;s be honest: George could have easily beat the end if Dream and sapnap weren&#39;t being a pair of muffinheads.
GeorgeNotFound,Love how the Enderman specifically target Sapnap and almost completely forget about dream.
GeorgeNotFound,Alternative title: George being a mother for 26 minutes straight.
GeorgeNotFound,Alternate title: sapnap get kidnapped every 5 seconds but dream gets kidnapped every 30 minutes
GeorgeNotFound,"I love how even though George had just finished explaining to them that they would get captured by any hostile mobs, they were all still shocked that Dream was captured by the spider at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne8WPQ4zcp4&amp;t=1m53s"">1:53</a>"
GeorgeNotFound,This video in a nutshell:<br>George - <b>The Babysitter</b><br>Dream - <b>The Polite one</b><br>Sapnap - <b>Always getting kidnapped by ranboo</b>
GeorgeNotFound,"How Dream asks for help: “George, please help me.”<br>Sapnap: GEORGEEEEEEE HELPPPPPPP"
GeorgeNotFound,Dream: “I want to see what it’s like”<br>George and Sapnap: <b>wait-</b><br><br>literally 2 seconds later: <b>spider grabs dream and runs away</b>
GeorgeNotFound,"Let&#39;s be honest, if Dream and Sapnap stayed in The End&#39;s spawn without opening a hole like they were told to do, George could have easily taken out the Enderdragon since he didn&#39;t have to worry about the Enderman chasing him and the enderdragon was also targetting Sapnap and Dream so he only had to break the crystals and wait for the Enderdragon to come down, but Sapnap and Dream ruined it because they opened the hole and got caught, it was still pretty funny to see them getting caught and then the mobs just constantly trying to speedrun through minecraft to get away from George and the best parts were definetly Sapnap desperately screaming his lugs out for George to savee him whenever he got caught. 🤣"
GeorgeNotFound,"Dream and SapNap: &quot;Save me, George!&quot;<br>George, on the verge of losing all his sanity: OMG I&#39;M TRYING, GIVE ME A SECOND!!!"
GeorgeNotFound,Dream and Sapnap: screams and begs for help.<br>George: casually continues mining his iron.
GeorgeNotFound,Alternate title: <b>George trying to save his friends from Ranboo’s half brothers for 26 minutes and 14 seconds</b>
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne8WPQ4zcp4&amp;t=22m20s"">22:20</a> Kidnapped by a boat, quite unexpected<br><br>Also, Dream was so frantic about George not doing enough to save him, but him and Sapnap could have prevented it if they didn&#39;t dig and stayed safe."
GeorgeNotFound,Daily Fun Fact:<br><b>Endermen</b> teleport every 20 seconds or teleport when harmed. Teleport range is about 20 blocks.
GeorgeNotFound,"You know, if George was a world record speedrunner, he would let the mods kidnap Dream an Sapnap, while George goes to speedrun the game in under 30 minutes. But if he did that we have no content."
GeorgeNotFound,The fact that Dream asked for help so calmly means he’s so done being the Danzel in distress 🙂
GeorgeNotFound,"To be fair, the game should not let you lose your hunger, its actually really hard to follow them when you are constantly having to look for food"
GeorgeNotFound,It’s all fun and games until a mob kidnaps you and you have no friends
GeorgeNotFound,"My first time watching GeorgeNotFound, now I know why people like watching him"
GeorgeNotFound,We love George no matter how many times he let&#39;s his friends get kidnapped ❤
GeorgeNotFound,Sapnap: <b>exists</b><br>Enderman : &quot;And I took that personally &quot;
GeorgeNotFound,Its funny how even though I know what dream looks like I still imagine him as a voice with no face 😭
GeorgeNotFound,When the name &quot;dreamwastaken&quot; actually starts to make sense.
GeorgeNotFound,"They need to do this again, BUT sapnap and dream need to protect George lol"
GeorgeNotFound,alternate title: endermen hating sapnap for 26 minutes and 14 seconds
GeorgeNotFound,I can&#39;t believe they thought this was even possible knowing the end is full of the fastest mob of this challenge
GeorgeNotFound,Dream: Literally the most smart Minecraft player<br><br>Also Dream: WHAT EM I SUPPOSE TO DO
GeorgeNotFound,Another hilariously entertaining video. That clutch to save Dream from the ghast was sick btw lol
GeorgeNotFound,Alternative Title: George taking his parental role as the oldest of the group.
GeorgeNotFound,Dream gets captured: George help me<br>Sapnap gets captured: GEORGEEEE
GeorgeNotFound,I keep imagining them as like a family where George is the parent and Dream and Snapnap are like twins that won&#39;t stop following each other lmao
GeorgeNotFound,"I&#39;m actually amazed at how in particular positions of this video, the skeletons, zombies and drowned are standing in a bunch to kidnap Sap and Dream."
GeorgeNotFound,I love how George looks like hes held hostage when hes looking at the camera in the intro 😭
GeorgeNotFound,Alternate title: George trying to save his friends from being kidnapped from mobs for 26 minutes 14 seconds
GeorgeNotFound,"I love how Dream is such a good and capable Minecrafter… until he has to do anything where George is responsible for keeping him safe, at which point he becomes a rambunctious child who can’t keep himself out of trouble for five minutes."
GeorgeNotFound,I love how Sapnap is always the one who gets kidnapped bye the enderman :&#39;&#39;P
GeorgeNotFound,"Not sure if this has ever been done or not, but I want you and Dream to try and beat Minecraft with a shared inventory. That could also include  shared armor if you wanted to."
GeorgeNotFound,Alternative title: Ranboo’s half brothers hating Sapnap while George tries to play the game and Dream shouts at them for taking his diamonds
GeorgeNotFound,George has a saviour complex throughout the videos and the rest.
GeorgeNotFound,"I would love to see this again, you guys got so close to beating it!"
GeorgeNotFound,The name Dreamwastaken is starting to make a lot more sense…
GeorgeNotFound,Ok but is no one gonna talk about how good he is at running? man is SMOOTH on the hills.
GeorgeNotFound,Sapnap: i give them a flower as a peace treaty<br>George: and for the peace treaty they get BLOWN UP<br>Me: did you guys swap places or something-
GeorgeNotFound,This is probably my favorite video with this trio lmao the never ending chaos 😂
GeorgeNotFound,"I feel like out of the dream team, george is the only one capable of being a parent."
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne8WPQ4zcp4&amp;t=5m35s"">5:35</a> I just love how satisfied they are about the geode 🥰"
GeorgeNotFound,Alternate title: <b>&quot;George protecting his kids from surprise adoption&quot;</b>
GeorgeNotFound,Feel like I’m watching a mom trying to keep up with her kids in Walmart 😂
GeorgeNotFound,I found george :3
GeorgeNotFound,I love the fact George doesn&#39;t realise just how obvious his particles are because he can&#39;t see red
GeorgeNotFound,"FOR PEOPLE SORTING BY NEW:<br><br>The video is frozen from about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuJAfwSCOGs&amp;t=21m00s"">21:00</a> onward due to corruption.   It became corrupted sometime between July 14-21, 2021.  It was uncorrupted and perfectly fine for almost a year, meaning this is probably a YouTube screw up and not George&#39;s fault."
GeorgeNotFound,"INFO FOR EVERYONE SORTING BY NEW:<br>The video is corrupted. At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuJAfwSCOGs&amp;t=21m01s"">21:01</a> the video stops and is stuck on a single frame, with sound not playing. If you want to see the full, uncorrupted version of the video, you can put the URL of this video in the Wayback Machine, then choose December 25, 2020 for the date.<br><br>For anyone bored to go do that, it was Bad who won. George heard the portal, dug and found it. He went through, and Bad chased him up a mountain where he shot at George and killed him."
GeorgeNotFound,It feels a little weird without Dream screaming “OH GEORGE” every five minutes
GeorgeNotFound,Now George knows what it is like to be Dream whilst manhunt. But Dream is tracked and followed by four people.
GeorgeNotFound,"Minecraft manhunt, but the hunter knows everything in the runner&#39;s inventory"
GeorgeNotFound,When Dream hunts: No mercy brother.<br><br>When BadBoyHalo hunts: “Hey George wanna get wheat together?”
GeorgeNotFound,Manhunt: &quot;stop the speed runner as soon as possible&quot;<br>George and Bad: &quot;Sharing is Caring&quot;
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuJAfwSCOGs&amp;t=8m53s"">8:53</a> I love how George just screams and it cuts out, perfectly cut screams 😂"
GeorgeNotFound,Badboyhalo: <b>*Gently taps a zombie pigman*</b><br>Every other zombie pigman in a 100 mile radius: <b>Bonjour</b>
GeorgeNotFound,I didn’t think anyone besides Dream could make a good manhunt yet here we are
GeorgeNotFound,"Manhunt whenever Dream is there : <b>planning, scheming, killing, screaming intensified</b><br><br>George and BBh as the hunter : <b>mining wheat together in the village</b>"
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuJAfwSCOGs&amp;t=14m04s"">14:04</a>  bad: “I swear” <br>George: ”Don&#39;t swear!”"
GeorgeNotFound,George&#39;s trail: <b>an actual trail</b><br>Bad&#39;s trail: <b>like 90 or so pigmen that he annoyed</b>
GeorgeNotFound,I love how dream and george introduced the new two hunters with their own unique versions of manhunt
GeorgeNotFound,George+Bad= <b>scared noises</b><br><br>George+sapnap= <b>terrified noises</b><br><br>George+dream= <b>SCREEeEEEEEEeeeeeCcHH!!!!!</b>
GeorgeNotFound,"George did well, but damn, Dream really is on a whole &#39;nother level. He rarely messes up sprinting, jumps, water to land, and knows when to keep pushing or backing down. There were a few moments that I think Bad was super low but George just ran."
GeorgeNotFound,I love how Bad&#39;s IQ scales all the way up when he&#39;s not with Skeppy.
GeorgeNotFound,"Bad is the nicest and most gentlemanny detective<br>&quot;I&#39;m still hunting you, keep running&quot;"
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuJAfwSCOGs&amp;t=6m20s"">6:20</a> proof that dream instilled fear into bad and caused him to have ptsd 😂. He wasn’t close to hitting range from george, and he still ran thinking he was about to get hit into the ravine"
GeorgeNotFound,"okay!! for everyone who is newer and didnt see this video when it was uploaded, i am so sorry you all didnt see the intense ending. so if ur wondering, no its not your wifi, and no this is not george&#39;s fault. it was fine and i watched it multiple times up until recently where i tried to re-watch it for nostalgia and realized its corrupted. anywhere after about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuJAfwSCOGs&amp;t=21m00s"">21:00</a> its frozen!!! sorry. and if you are wondering, badboyhalo did win if i can remember correctly. sorry to all the newer people discovering or getting recommended this video (,: !!"
GeorgeNotFound,My favorite thing about badboyhalo is that his name and skin make him look intimidating but he’s literally the softest person on the SMP ❤️😭😭
GeorgeNotFound,the vibes from dream’s “oh george~” and bad’s are completely different
GeorgeNotFound,"Bad: looking for George<br>Bad: finds George<br>Bad: starts RUNNING from George<br>Bad: &quot;WAIT, WHY AM <b>I</b> RUNNING FROM YOU?&quot;"
GeorgeNotFound,“There’s endermen chasing me!”<br>“There’s piglins after me!”<br>“There’s bad chasing me!”
GeorgeNotFound,George: <b>Makes shield</b><br>Also George: Doesn’t use it ever
GeorgeNotFound,George and Bad: <b>Having a fun friendly competition</b> <br><br>George and Dream: <b>If you die in the game you die in real life</b>
GeorgeNotFound,You can always predict George’s health by the pitch of his scream...
GeorgeNotFound,"For those watching, the video is indeed corrupted. It’s not just you, but something went wrong sometime after the original upload causing it to end frozen."
GeorgeNotFound,Dream: Speedrun Master<br>TechnoBlade: PvP Master<br>George: Scream Master<br>Bad: Muffin Master
GeorgeNotFound,"This feels a lot more pleasant to watch tho, it feels like it’s more fair, and with less screaming :)"
GeorgeNotFound,Literally the WHOLE Entire Video in a Nutshell<br><br>Badboyhalo: &quot;You Muffin!&quot;
GeorgeNotFound,George: &quot;runs away after taking a single heart from bad while holding a stone axe yet bad has a wooden sword&quot;<br>Also George: I think I was kind of low actually
GeorgeNotFound,George: has a shield which could save him<br>also George: doesn’t use it
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuJAfwSCOGs&amp;t=13m33s"">13:33</a> Badboyhalo &quot;I swear...&quot;<br>George: &quot;Don&#39;t swear!&quot;"
GeorgeNotFound,George : Wants to make a manhunt video.<br>His vocal cords : My time has come
GeorgeNotFound,Aang: WHERE’S APPA<br>Thanos: WHERE’S THE STONE<br>George: WHERE’S THE PORTAL
GeorgeNotFound,"When Bad said &quot;Wait why am I running?&quot;, it made me wonder what Dream exactly has done to the other Muffinteers."
GeorgeNotFound,The fact that Bad was confusing George was the same strat he used for Dream
GeorgeNotFound,Bad: &quot;Come here george!&quot;<br><br> George: <b>manhunt memories</b>
GeorgeNotFound,&quot;Where&#39;s that ravine I want that ravine&quot; While he doesn&#39;t realize he can legit just retrace his steps.
GeorgeNotFound,The evolution of George&#39;s mic quality over time is just stunning
GeorgeNotFound,Everytime George can’t hit something he always says “my arms aren’t long enough” and I find it the cutest thing ever
GeorgeNotFound,"Dream when he&#39;s in these types of situations: &quot;It&#39;s simple. We, uh, kill the hunter.&quot;"
GeorgeNotFound,this challenge would be a piece of cake for george if he had a little bit of confidence. hes a better player than bad
GeorgeNotFound,BBH: “Oh there you are! Hi George!” <br>Dream: <b>ominous chuckling</b>
GeorgeNotFound,This video is the proof that George doesn&#39;t get views just because of dream♥️
GeorgeNotFound,"I love how Badboy still has PTSD from when Dream shoved him into a ravine <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuJAfwSCOGs&amp;t=6m00s"">6:00</a>"
GeorgeNotFound,"The video is frozen from about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuJAfwSCOGs&amp;t=21m00s"">21:00</a> onward due to corruption.   It became corrupted sometime between July 14-21, 2021.  It was uncorrupted and perfectly fine for almost a year, meaning this is probably a YouTube screw up and not George&#39;s fault."
GeorgeNotFound,"It’s crazy to think that George and Dream are going to be someone’s childhood Minecraft channels.  Instead of like, Ssundee, DanTDM, Captain Sparkles, PopularMMOS, and Stampy."
GeorgeNotFound,Nobody:<br>Dream: <b>Finds a mob that can kill him</b><br>Dream:  <b>Has only 3 hearts of health</b><br>George: &quot;Be careful Dream&quot;<br>Also Dream: <b>Decides to hit it</b>
GeorgeNotFound,Everytime Dream unexpectedly takes damage he starts speaking enchantment table language
GeorgeNotFound,Dream calling a wolf a woof is genuinely the most adorable thing ive ever heard
GeorgeNotFound,I think it&#39;s safe to say that we need a Dream POV
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfOakuOT5dY&amp;t=3m08s"">3:08</a>  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfOakuOT5dY&amp;t=8m51s"">8:51</a>  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfOakuOT5dY&amp;t=15m25s"">15:25</a>   Is it just me or does anyone else feel like dream is becoming more and more fluent in gibberish :)"
GeorgeNotFound,It’s so cute how dream screams and you see this little parrot flying away across the screen from the danger
GeorgeNotFound,Dream: <b>repeats George</b> <br>George: * silence*<br>George: <b>hits dream</b><br>Dream: PËKÆK
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfOakuOT5dY&amp;t=22m15s"">22:15</a><br>George : <i>(accidentally swipes Dream with his iron sword whilst fighting a skeleton)</i><br>Dream : <i>(relearns Traditional Chinese mixed with The Korean Alphabet for some reason)</i>"
GeorgeNotFound,"Man, Dream creates a whole new breed of language whenever he gets hurt."
GeorgeNotFound,I love how Dream just turns into a little innocent child that just wants to help whenever he’s turned into a Minecraft mob but then he’s a dirty minded teakettle green screen blob every other video 😂
GeorgeNotFound,Can we just appreciate how George keeps the feather the whole video 🥰
GeorgeNotFound,"dream in his videos: <b>very focused and serious speedrunner</b><br><br>dream in george&#39;s videos: HedWiG, cAn yOU go tElL ROn"
GeorgeNotFound,Dream: there’s a woof here <br>George: a what?<br>Dream: a woof<br>That was cute and funny at the same time
GeorgeNotFound,george: <b>fighting the skeleton</b><br>dream: <b>comes out of nowhere</b><br>arrow: <b>*hits dream*</b><br>dream: &quot;aeyupikeshou&quot;
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfOakuOT5dY&amp;t=20m06s"">20:06</a> dream singing while george collects seeds is just the best thing ever"
GeorgeNotFound,I think George knows what all bird owners feel when taking care of their parrots
GeorgeNotFound,"Dreams like a kid when he&#39;s a parrot 🤣<br>Dream: Look at meeee, I can break the crystals<br>George: Dont do it<br>Dream: Why not?<br>Dream: It only does half a heart<br>George: Your risking dieing"
GeorgeNotFound,dream’s channel: <b>*intense gameplay*</b><br>dream’s second channel: “im like a disney princess!”<br>george’s channel: <b>*wholesome bird squeaking*</b>
GeorgeNotFound,GeorgeNotFound: &quot;Why are you making this 100x harder?!&quot;<br>Dream: * Dying with laughter *
GeorgeNotFound,"George: &quot;Dream, I&#39;m on three hearts, you&#39;ve almost got more health than me.&quot;<br>Dream:  *evil laughter *proceeds to hit George<br>              &quot;Now I have more health than you.&quot; *laughs<br>George: &quot;No Dream! Oh my... No, I have three hearts.&quot;<br>Dream:   *hits him again<br>George:  &quot;Okay, I shouldn&#39;t have said that.&quot;"
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfOakuOT5dY&amp;t=3m07s"">3:07</a> i love how dream starts speaking enchanting table whenever he&#39;s about to die, as if its a prayer to the gods to help him<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfOakuOT5dY&amp;t=8m51s"">8:51</a><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfOakuOT5dY&amp;t=15m25s"">15:25</a><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfOakuOT5dY&amp;t=22m15s"">22:15</a><br>... new headcanon?"

GeorgeNotFound,Dream looses 90% of his brain cells at every intro of ‘Minecraft but my friend is a animal.!’
GeorgeNotFound,Dream: Attracts like 20 endermen<br><br>Dream: <b>&quot;I&#39;m about to end this man&#39;s whole career&quot;</b><br><br><b>*Sits on George&#39;s shoulder*</b>
GeorgeNotFound,"George:  &quot;Do you have any strategies on staying alive, Dream?&quot;<br>Dream:  &quot;Yeah I can fly, so I just go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr&quot;"
GeorgeNotFound,Dream: Watch out there&#39;s lava there!<br>George: <b>Walks into lava</b><br>Dream: I&#39;m going to look out for stuff<br>George: <b>is still on fire</b>
GeorgeNotFound,George:&quot;You brought me a feather&quot;<br>Dream:&quot;Ron sends his regards&quot; <b>starts laughing</b><br>Love that quote xD
GeorgeNotFound,"Dream is fast and can basically fly, he only has 3 hearts, he likes to speedrun things, and his only purpose is to scout ahead and deal extra damage if needed ...<br><b>Dream is a TF2 Scout Main</b>"
GeorgeNotFound,<b>I think Dream and George are such a great duo!</b>
GeorgeNotFound,George: “omg there’s an enderman after me”<br><br>Dream: <b>casually flys around with like 2 dozen enderman following him</b>
GeorgeNotFound,Alternate title: George and dream being protective for 30 minutes and 30 seconds
GeorgeNotFound,I’ve never realized how fast parrots are until this video-
GeorgeNotFound,Dream: <b>repeats George</b><br>George: <b>silence</b><br>Also George: <b>hits dream</b><br>Dream: PEÆCOK
GeorgeNotFound,Goerge: I have no idea where are you<br>Dream: <b>Apperas behind george</b><br>Dream: I-i&#39;m right behind you
GeorgeNotFound,George:*feeding him seeds*<br><br>If sapnap was there:*feeding him cookies*
GeorgeNotFound,its hard to believe that dream is one of the best minecraft speedrunners when you watch this video
GeorgeNotFound,Dream gives off pure Disney animal sidekick energy in these videos
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfOakuOT5dY&amp;t=19m47s"">19:47</a> Dream being Dream parrot<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfOakuOT5dY&amp;t=22m15s"">22:15</a><br>George:Fighting a skeleton<br>dream came out of nowhere<br>Skeleton almost shot Dream<br>Dream: <b>Alyuikeshou</b>"
GeorgeNotFound,I love how dream suddenly panics when their about to go to the nether. <br>George- “there’s so much cobble here-“<br>“AAAAHHHH!!! George help help! Feed me!!”
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfOakuOT5dY&amp;t=16m03s"">16:03</a> was so adorable it was literally like a movie"
GeorgeNotFound,George: looking for flint<br><br>Also George: has flint in his inventory but doesn’t care to check
GeorgeNotFound,George : &quot;We need seeds for you Dream&quot;<br>Also George : Walks past pumpkins who&#39;s seeds he could&#39;ve used
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfOakuOT5dY&amp;t=26m14s"">26:14</a><br><br>My favourite moment &lt;3"
GeorgeNotFound,I laughed so hard at the crowd of endermen. Watching them chase after Dream was hilarious.
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfOakuOT5dY&amp;t=17m34s"">17:34</a> i love how George kept dreams feathers."
GeorgeNotFound,"When dream kept on copying what George was saying I couldn’t stop laughing😂 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfOakuOT5dY&amp;t=0m30s"">0:30</a>"
GeorgeNotFound,George: needs seeds<br>Also George: runs past pumpkin patch
GeorgeNotFound,"Alternate title: Minecraft, but my friend learns a new language every time he gets attacked..."
GeorgeNotFound,I love how dream as the weakest mob is the mob that dream wins with George
GeorgeNotFound,"george: “alright, I’ve got a new tactic”<br>george: falls off the map"
GeorgeNotFound,&quot;I have a new tactic&quot; <b>Falls out of the world</b><br>Has the same energy as :&quot;Ok guys I have a plan&quot; <b>Leaves game</b>
GeorgeNotFound,"Dream when George wins: &quot;youre literally a cheater, youre so cheating&quot; <br><br>Dream when he wins: &quot;youre literally trash&quot;"
GeorgeNotFound,George: &#39;Okay here comes my new tactic&#39;<br> <i>sets himself on fire</i>
GeorgeNotFound,George when he dies: <b>SCREECHES</b><br><br>Dream when he dies: “mic go yum yum”
GeorgeNotFound,"Explaining george’s knockback: George is from Britain, hypixel is in US. When you have high ping, kb is delayed, so it sometimes stacks, like your 1st hit doesn’t deal knock back, but second hit kb is 2x so it sends your opponent flying"
GeorgeNotFound,i wonder if Georges neighbours ever think he&#39;s getting murdered whenever he screeches lol
GeorgeNotFound,"Dream falls off of the map <b>&quot;Please, George. We&#39;re not going to talk about it.&quot;</b><br>...1 minute passes...<br>George falls off of the map <b>&quot;AHAHAHAAAA, IDIOT, THIS GAME IS EASY&quot;</b>"

GeorgeNotFound,"I love how Dream says George has a big forehead, when Dream&#39;s head is literally his forehead"
GeorgeNotFound,Dream: Sees George<br><br>Also Dream: wheezing noises intensify
GeorgeNotFound,I like how Dream eats his mic when he dies in a stupid way
GeorgeNotFound,the ending lol
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaO869h9s2w&amp;t=15m42s"">15:42</a> I could listen to this forever, imagine if the whole world heard this for 24 hours straight."
GeorgeNotFound,"Gorge: makes 10 hit combo<br><b>no reaction</b><br>Gorge: makes 2 hit combo<br><b>&quot;Oooh,what a fat combo ;)&quot;</b>"
GeorgeNotFound,"I miss this time when George could individually easily compete with dream head to head, but obviously since this we all know how much dream has improved, and for george, it’s been more or less stagnant"
GeorgeNotFound,Some people underestimate how good George actually is even though he lost the duel
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaO869h9s2w&amp;t=13m41s"">13:41</a> is it just me or does dream’s laugh sound like the McDonald’s theme"
GeorgeNotFound,"Can we just appreciate <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaO869h9s2w&amp;t=15m51s"">15:51</a> the skill that comes with desperation"
GeorgeNotFound,Watching this after dream beats like 30 Mc YouTubers 80 something to 2 makes me realize how much better he’s gotten in a year
GeorgeNotFound,Dream: loses almost every round<br>Also Dream after he finally kills George: YOU&#39;RE SO BAD
GeorgeNotFound,George: there&#39;s no concept of weight in minecraft<br>Pressure plates: am I a joke to you?
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaO869h9s2w&amp;t=12m12s"">12:12</a> Top ten most epic screams in history"
GeorgeNotFound,i didn’t know george could screech so loud
GeorgeNotFound,George’s screeching and dream’s wheezing is the ultimate duo
GeorgeNotFound,"couldnt stop laughing at dream making fun of george and his inventory, his wheezing, george&#39;s screaming. plus the end lmfaoo"
GeorgeNotFound,George: *Does anything funny stupid<br>Dream: *Teapot Whistle
GeorgeNotFound,‘My name is George and I need to sort my inventory’<br>I could watch dream doing that for hours on end...
GeorgeNotFound,"I always find myself coming back to this video every few months, it&#39;s just so dynamic and fun :)"
GeorgeNotFound,Let’s all just have a moment of silence for everybody’s ears after listening to George’s commentary with ear phones
GeorgeNotFound,Dream must have like 10 spare headsets/mics in his draw bc every vid he always smashes up his mic/headset at least once.
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaO869h9s2w&amp;t=16m26s"">16:26</a>, what a perfectly cut scream"
GeorgeNotFound,"this just goes to show george is quite good, and dream wasnt crazy back in the day. at some point the blob surpassed his limits, though"
GeorgeNotFound,"The chat: Wow, george sure screams loud A year later: Banshee George laughing in the distance"
GeorgeNotFound,"Gorge almost got an epic comeback but this happened <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaO869h9s2w&amp;t=16m25s"">16:25</a>"
GeorgeNotFound,I like how George and dream don’t post the same videos but do their own things
GeorgeNotFound,"I like how no body complains like alot- when something glitches because everyone glitches, its the game"
GeorgeNotFound,Watching George and Dream videos is like watching RomComs where they don’t know they’re in love.
GeorgeNotFound,"so we’re not going to talk about how dream just straight up ate his mic out of anger <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>understandable, have a nice day"
GeorgeNotFound,George: “alright new tactic”<br>Also George: <b>sets himself on fire</b>
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaO869h9s2w&amp;t=12m12s"">12:12</a> new in the Fandom but already keeping track of all of George&#39;s iconic screams"
GeorgeNotFound,"Judge: George, you won the case.<br><br>George: new tactic<br><br><b>Proceeds to sentence himself to death</b>"

GeorgeNotFound,"I know this is old, but every time I see George fighting and getting comboed in a 1.8 dual, all I can think is &quot;Use your rod! It&#39;s not just for free hits, it stops combos damnit!&quot;"
GeorgeNotFound,His shrill of excitement when he won that uhc duel tho
GeorgeNotFound,you can see how bad dream is in the beginning and how much better he is today
GeorgeNotFound,George falling off the edge and screaming is just 👌🤣
GeorgeNotFound,George screeching and dream wheeze laugh is the best combo.
GeorgeNotFound,George: <b>smashes Dream&#39;s bed in Bed Wars</b><br>also George: <b>blows the Hypixel showdown by falling off a bridge</b>
GeorgeNotFound,George: I&#39;m the best player!<br>Also George: literally uses a head before a gap in UHC duels
GeorgeNotFound,"Challenge idea: Wherever dream looks turns to lava, wherever George looks turns to water,"
GeorgeNotFound,Dream: “I’m the best Minecraft player in the world.”<br>Also Dream: (walks up to a pig) “I found a chicken!”
GeorgeNotFound,"Dream talking about George: He&#39;s a great guy, I love him, go check him out. <br>George talking about Dream: He&#39;s an alright youtuber I guess."
GeorgeNotFound,George: &quot;This is a bad spawn.&quot;<br><br>Dream: &quot;There&#39;s a fortress right there!&quot;<br><br>The moral of the story is speed runners only get good spawns.
GeorgeNotFound,Medusa: I can turn people into stone with my sight<br><br>Dream &amp; George: <b>Allow us to introduce ourselves</b>
GeorgeNotFound,the fact that dream dropped a rose bush when they were in the stronghold and george picked it up and kept it is so cute
GeorgeNotFound,Dream: <b>goes underwater</b><br>George: <b>is scared because dream might drown</b><br><br>Also George: <b>stares dream down</b>
GeorgeNotFound,george: the water is deadly!<br><br>enderman : always has been...
GeorgeNotFound,"You can hear a difference in volume when George screams, so thank you editor for trying to protect our ears"
GeorgeNotFound,George: Don&#39;t look at the iron<br>Dream: I&#39;m not<br>Dream: Looks at the iron
GeorgeNotFound,George: Look at him (referring to the creeper) <br>Dream:  (mumbles something) <br>George:  <b>LoOk aT hIm</b>
GeorgeNotFound,I love how just after killing the ender dragon the first thing that Dream does is hit George.
GeorgeNotFound,Dream&#39;s videos: We coded Minecraft so...<br><br>George&#39;s videos: I coded Minecraft so...
GeorgeNotFound,George: &quot;Everywhere I look turns into a bedrock!&quot;<br>~look into his PC screen~<br>~video ends~
GeorgeNotFound,George: Oh no! Dream you’re <b>drowning!</b><br>Also George: <b>keeps looking directly above him</b>
GeorgeNotFound,imagine the challenge ends beautifully with a buried end spawn
GeorgeNotFound,Imagine being a zombie and seeing a man with glasses and a green man who turn everything into an indestructible stone.
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fdyLUeVhI&amp;t=7m45s"">7:45</a> <br>He said there’s more diamonds, I thought he meant the red stone."
GeorgeNotFound,"Dream: <b>completed Minecraft with 3 hunters, without dying</b><br>Dream: <b>dies to a enderman</b>"
GeorgeNotFound,Who ever knew the most suspenseful part was getting through a door.
GeorgeNotFound,It’s all fun and games with spinning creeper till he decides to explode
GeorgeNotFound,I love how dream repeats himself<br>Dream: yea this is it this is it!<br>Dream: right there right there!
GeorgeNotFound,There needs to be a counter for how many times George’s yells “I’m dying!” While he is at full health
GeorgeNotFound,I love how George just says &quot;nice&quot; when Dream says &quot;I found another endermen here!&quot; it&#39;s so funny!!
GeorgeNotFound,Portal: easy<br>Nether: easy<br>Getting through doors in stronghold: <b>Strategic planning</b>
GeorgeNotFound,Finding this channel in quarantine was one of the things I actually did right in life
GeorgeNotFound,George: &quot;I don&#39;t want to spoil anything but the ending is epic&quot;<br>Me: He turned the dragon into bedrock didn&#39;t he...
GeorgeNotFound,"&quot;I remember this chest and there was nothign&quot;<br>&quot;Every bedrock here is a failed gravel&quot;<br>Yep, this summarizes my luck"
GeorgeNotFound,dream trying to break the bedrock and then going “wait what” is so funny 😭
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fdyLUeVhI&amp;t=19m18s"">19:18</a> he didn&#39;t drop the flower that Dream dropped... its just so beautiful to me"
GeorgeNotFound,&quot;What could we use 4 diamonds for?&quot; &quot;I guess a 3rd pair of boots&quot;<br><br><br>2 diamond swords: &quot;Are we a joke to you?&quot;
GeorgeNotFound,Can we all appreciate that George lowered his volume at the end cause ge screamed
GeorgeNotFound,George: Swings axe at cow<br>Also George:  &quot;Dream you killed it&quot;
GeorgeNotFound,i love how dream and george almost didn´t flirt before and now they literally get lost in their own little world every single stream or video.
GeorgeNotFound,I like how george AND dream call the ender dragon a he then corrects themselves lmao
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fdyLUeVhI&amp;t=24m37s"">24:37</a> Luckily the end spawn wasn&#39;t underground, or else they would have been stuck in a hole forever..."
GeorgeNotFound,George: Everyblock we look at turns to bedrock.<br>The air blocks: Am I a joke to you.
GeorgeNotFound,Dream: oh look there’s a chicken here <br>Gogy: that’s not a chicken. <br>Dream:✨wheeze✨
GeorgeNotFound,George: “The water is deadly!”<br>Endermam: <b>FINALLY</b>
GeorgeNotFound,George : “come here pig”<br>Sheep : “what am I to you?”
GeorgeNotFound,is it just me or do i love how all of george’s videos like these end with him actually winning unlike dream
GeorgeNotFound,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fdyLUeVhI&amp;t=8m45s"">8:45</a><br>I burst out laughing at how he just descends from the darkness."
GeorgeNotFound,damn they rly did this whole challenge when they could’ve just closed their eyes?? smh
GeorgeNotFound,"I would just like to thank the editor for what they did at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fdyLUeVhI&amp;t=26m00s"">26:00</a>"
GeorgeNotFound,George: THE CREEPERS GONNA BLOW UP MY DIAMONDS!<br>Dream: dont worry ill take care of it!<br>Dream: <b>looks at the diamonds</b> you&#39;re welcome.<br>George: ...
GeorgeNotFound,I love how George says he is low when he is literally regenerating
GeorgeNotFound,George: dosnt get flint after 20 peices of gravel.<br>Dream: <b>KETTLE NOISES INTENSIFY</b>
GeorgeNotFound,Does anyone realize that George is a good coder?

GeorgeNotFound,I can&#39;t stop laughing at Dream&#39;s wheeze
Youtuber,Comments
iHasCupquake,Well this is a crossover I never knew I needed 😳 I love it
iHasCupquake,I’m just gonna say she is AMAZING at art 🤩
iHasCupquake,Imagine a FNAF map in among us
iHasCupquake,Y do i want these skins to actually be in among us. also i really love the puppet one. she has always been my fav character.
iHasCupquake,Among Us Meets FNAF... <br><b>the crossover that was meant to be</b>
iHasCupquake,"I love them, Your really creative :D"
iHasCupquake,I remember seeing the Marionette Cosplay. Good times they were. I totally forgot she does cosplays. Man I&#39;m just rediscovering Tiff all over again
iHasCupquake,I like how she calls funtime foxy mangle
iHasCupquake,Wait she does songs now? I remember the animated shorts she did for FNAF but I didn&#39;t know she did songs? I&#39;m absolutely floored right now
iHasCupquake,Cupquake: I won&#39;t jumpscare you<br>Me: Still looking away
iHasCupquake,They look so cute! You did so good! I love your drawings!!! 🥰
iHasCupquake,OMG I can&#39;t get enough of her amazing art and she is so funny and sweet can&#39;t wait for another among us cross over with her drawings
iHasCupquake,I was still expecting that jumpscare...
iHasCupquake,Im loving this series. All of them look so good but balloon boys detailing is done so well
iHasCupquake,chica looks like a sarcastic teenager at a party!
iHasCupquake,I love these skin drawings for among us and other games!
iHasCupquake,SHE LITERALLY RAN SO THAT OTHER GAMER GIRLS COULD WALK SHE WAS THE OG
iHasCupquake,Yes! I like this!! I hope you really enjoyed it.
iHasCupquake,you need to make mods for among us where we can use this characters!!!
iHasCupquake,Absolutely love your art &lt;3
iHasCupquake,I love these types of videos &lt;3
iHasCupquake,I remember her old Minecraft videos when her channel was boomin. This was the only reason I came back but then I saw she can barely get passed 30K views and my childhood nostalgia hit me hard man...
iHasCupquake,"I clicked on here expecting to watch some more Among us, and i forgot to remember Kratos&#39; advice about expectations. Still a good vid tho."
iHasCupquake,I didn&#39;t know she did drawing? What have I missed all these years?
iHasCupquake,I would honestly prefer fnaf going into dead by daylight. But among us would do good too I guess
iHasCupquake,"I&#39;m sorry, but the puppet, or marionette, is a weird case like mangle. In the Freddy Files books, the robot itself is referred to as male, but the soul inside of the robot is Charlotte, a girl. I always get so frustrated about how to identify it, so I just call it &quot;her&quot;, since Charlotte is such an important character in the series. Am I wrong, or do you agree?"
iHasCupquake,It would be so amazing if this was actually in among us
iHasCupquake,My favourite one is the puppet :)<br>Make more FNaF characters as Among Us skins Tiff!!
iHasCupquake,"My favorite skin was marionette, the specs of white in the eyes really added to it, y&#39;know?"
iHasCupquake,I love how cupquake still loves fnaf today
iHasCupquake,"You should do another FNAF one, but with some of the outlander characters from Pizza Simulator! I think that would be HILARIOUS!!!! aka the frog, pig... those guys. Pokemon characters would also be a lot of fun!"
iHasCupquake,I really think she should do Steven universe for the theme next I was asking if she could do it in the twich chat but there were millions of other people talking over me but some ppl agreed with me that she should do Steven universe it would be cute
iHasCupquake,"Hey ! I just searched her name up and thank you for the Minecraft series, it really was my childhood.. so many years later that is crazy."
iHasCupquake,"If anyone comes for tiffy for saying Mangle while showing the Funtime Foxy deisgn,don&#39;t. It&#39;s something people can easily mess up when it comes to name, but she was going more for an approachable Mangle, which she did say, Funtime Foxy is literally just Mangle but put together and Mangle is broken up Funtime Foxy so she could really go for either design and say Mangle or Funtime Foxy and it would be okay because they&#39;re the same character, ones just the broken down version while the other one is put together properly."
iHasCupquake,More please i love your drawings. 😃 I was wondering if you could make among us princess&#39;s.
iHasCupquake,Ugh ma&#39;am we need makeup tutorialsss 😁 love you and this channel!! I use to watch you when I was like 4-5 grade and now I&#39;m back to help support your channel!!
iHasCupquake,That music box was so nostalgic! 🤗
iHasCupquake,Anyone know what she uses to draw these
iHasCupquake,WAIIITTT I do want Puppet in the game now! Its so simple yet so appealing! I love this video Cupquake &lt;3
iHasCupquake,holy crap you saw willy&#39;s wonderland movie trailer?! 😳 geez i thought i was alone 😬 but this movie is extremly creepy at all costs 😥 i bet you are probably gonna see it to be honest with you 😏 i mean after all everyone has to know if the movie is good or not 🙂 but anyways love the FNAF skins on the among us characters 😉 also im hyped for the new FNAF game 😀
iHasCupquake,These are so cool! I wanna use them in the game 😔
iHasCupquake,I love these videos!
iHasCupquake,Now I Want Those Skins In Among Us
iHasCupquake,She does such a great job when drawing them she is very skilled Tiffy thank you for giving me joy and being my first youtuber that I have ever watched thank you and stay safe and God bless you all. 🙃🙃❤️❤️🙃🙃❤️❤️😇😇🐈🐈🌷🌹🌷🌹
iHasCupquake,I think my favorite was the Valentine&#39;s themed one.
iHasCupquake,I would 100% buy one of these skins for $5.99 in among us
iHasCupquake,It&#39;s so adorable and I love it so much ❤️
iHasCupquake,Nice! Please do more animal crossing characters like the pink sheep one.
iHasCupquake,Wow it’s been 8 years since I watched your first oasis video I was barely 5 years old when I first started watching you and now I’m about to hit 14 all those good memories I had watching you 😔
iHasCupquake,Not gonna lie but she kinda looks like Daniella Monet the actor in victorious 😂
iHasCupquake,"Cupquake:&quot;the garden would be much better if they had white fences instead of these ugly brown ones&quot;<br>Me:&quot;woah,woah,woah. brown is beautiful.&quot;"
iHasCupquake,I’m crying my childhood 🥺😭 the opening brings me so much memories! I miss and loved my childhood a lot and I’m so glad you were a part of it Tiffy! <br><br>Man those days where I’d come home from school and just watch your videos on my iPod 4. UGH back then the only thing I care for was getting to watch the latest episodes of Oasis 😔 now ya girl is in college trying to get this degree.
iHasCupquake,I miss oasis so so much i really  really do and i hope that someday she will actually visit the world again on camera cuz that&#39;d be amazing!
iHasCupquake,I wonder how oasis would look in The regular minecraft texture pack:-)
iHasCupquake,"You should put glow stone hidden all through the waterfalls, it&#39;ll look pretty at night"
iHasCupquake,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYS2_AeUnxo&amp;t=31m44s"">31:44</a><br><br>Did anyone else face palm when she said &quot; I don&#39;t have any torches&quot; when see had some in her inventory"
iHasCupquake,I laughed so hard when David wouldn&#39;t come into the garden and you said that you were afraid that he had a fear of coming into gardens
iHasCupquake,Just discovered Minecraft 0asis! Loads more episodes to go! :)
iHasCupquake,Keep on making Oasis videos I love them so much:)
iHasCupquake,Thumbs up if u miss the original oasis
iHasCupquake,Make a patio near your pond! It would be awesome. Also you should have some villagers come over to visit as well. :3
iHasCupquake,I still love these vids almost a decade later… so much nostalgia
iHasCupquake,going through the old oasis video&#39;s! I LOVE CUPQUAKE
iHasCupquake,"I bet when this is finished , it will be huge but a great creation!"
iHasCupquake,A real wedding gift is the emerald Cupquake received.
iHasCupquake,who thinks cupquakes is awesome with purple hair.I KNOW I DO 😅
iHasCupquake,"You should put a white picket fence outside each level. Plus, the bird baths are off-center, the ones you put down today are on the path instead of in the middle! It was bugging me xD"
iHasCupquake,"With the minecraft comes alive mod, you should be able to actually pick chat choices so the villagers dont just say ramdom stuff, and plus it would by really cool to carry on conversations"
iHasCupquake,"I know this is over, but those sunflower seeds are for EATING"
iHasCupquake,I LOVE those white picket fences! And your flower garden!
iHasCupquake,Yeah ur a BIG role model to me and you have inspired me to do things! Please make another minecraft oasis episode! I&#39;m gonna watch this video again!
iHasCupquake,🎵&quot;So tell me what you want what you really really want&quot;🎵<br>Cupquake: &quot;I want my daughter to fish for me&quot;
iHasCupquake,"Tiff try getting an orchid! They&#39;re also low-maintainace and they also can live long, and if you forget to water it it won&#39;t die too quickly. We have 5 at home! They&#39;re beautiful!"
iHasCupquake,Rewatching the series again she could&#39;ve named one of her kids Poppy😁
iHasCupquake,I love the fan art at the end😊😊
iHasCupquake,"You should name all your female children after flowers like &quot; lily, Rose, Tulip, ect.&quot;"
iHasCupquake,"Baby Daisy is in David&#39;s inventory! Also for the sunflower seeds, you can only eat them."
iHasCupquake,Oasis looks so beautiful is it a seed?
iHasCupquake,"I doubt you&#39;re reading this Tiff, but it would make me and SO many other fans of Quxxn happy if you would mention her in your next Oasis. I saw your tweet and it made me smile, but it would be über awesome if you remembered her in a video. RIP Quxxn &lt;/3 (I will now watch this Oasis :])"
iHasCupquake,"Minecraft Comes Alive has always been a bit buggy. Some of the duplication bugs are downright funny! I always did wonder why Biomes O&#39; Plenty went with flower seeds being farmed rather than just using Bone Meal. It&#39;s changed a bit since then.  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23oasisnostalgia"">#oasisnostalgia</a>"
iHasCupquake,Ur giving the baby Miracle Gro?!<br>I think that might be poisonous.
iHasCupquake,please keep doing these amazing videos :)
iHasCupquake,"i just love how red randomly walks through the room
"
iHasCupquake,That fox in your coyfish pond is so adorable!
iHasCupquake,If you want to see the holes in the glass dome change you settings to connected textures and it would easy to see all the holes.
iHasCupquake,You are the best gamer ever! I play mine craft and sims because of you. Not to mention i started baking because of you. You are amazing and this serious is how I found you. Lots of love💗
iHasCupquake,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYS2_AeUnxo&amp;t=40m04s"">40:04</a><br>Me: Bless you.<br><br>Cupquake:Thank you! ^_^<br><br>Me: OMFG SHE CAN HEAR ME!!!"
iHasCupquake,Absolutely check David&#39;s inventory for baby Daisy. And I would be careful about animals getting into your pond that you made in this episode. Raccoons and foxes and kitties like to kill fish a LOT!
iHasCupquake,"Like everyone else is saying, get the pet whistle! It will Call your cats to you! Also, David&#39;s arm looked like it was holding something. He is probably holding Daisy. Check his inventory!"
iHasCupquake,The tap needs a 3 by 3 space of water under it to work
iHasCupquake,I love cupquake she does so many stuff and series for us and keeps us interested. I WILL NEVER UNSUBSCRIBE!!!!
iHasCupquake,"you should get more pets like Cat&#39;s, Bunny&#39;s, Fox&#39;s, and stuff like that."
iHasCupquake,I love that end picture :D
iHasCupquake,Yay!!Now all the Super Oasis Sundays are not blurry anymore.
iHasCupquake,I like how the gravel looks in this texture pack. It is less ugly
iHasCupquake,I know I&#39;m well over a year late... But I love you Cupquake! You are so good at commentary because you TALK and Interact with your veiwers!<br>I love you endings! &quot;My name is Cupquake... I&#39;ll see you all later... Bye!&quot;<br>&lt;3
iHasCupquake,This video made my sad day into a happy day full of laughter. Thank u for making videos
iHasCupquake,"You&#39;re a Faye!<br> When someone needs help or assistance, you&#39;re always happy to help and<br>there to save the day! You&#39;re very sweet, innocent and caring. In addition,<br>you always put others before yourself. You belong in the beautiful valley of<br>elves and faeries! A scene of long grassy hilltops and soothing flowing rivers.<br>Somewhere which is filled with wildlife! You hope that one day, someone<br>will return the same kindness you have done for them. You also hope that<br>one day you will meet the love you desire<br>.&gt;3&lt;"
iHasCupquake,Bun Bun (bunny)<br>Ham Ham (hamster)<br>Jam Jam (jelly)
iHasCupquake,"I have an idea you can use for your koi fish pond...... Make the whole bottom layer glowstone! :) So at night it will look pretty cool!
"
iHasCupquake,"i&#39;m 21 but do not feel guilty about watching this series! taking me back to when i used to be OBSESSED with the oasis series when i was 12. tiff you was a prominent figure in my childhood and you provided so much joy for me and my sister, so the nostalgia is hitting hard watching you play minecraft again! 🤍"
iHasCupquake,Why is no one talking about the introduction cards??! Whoever drew them is soo amazing! They look so cool!
iHasCupquake,We need tiff to have an attack ability where she summons wither roses around her 🥀💗
iHasCupquake,"That Scott guy is really the perfect necromancer… his eccentricity and aloofness, and his mannerisms. Definitely a shady character, stay safe girl."
iHasCupquake,tiff: “i love the color red (referring to red/mario.) just something about it-“<br><br>joey (wearing a red hat): “are you flirting with me? you’re getting kinda close. you trying to kiss me?”<br><br>I’M SCREAMING
iHasCupquake,Always such a laugh with Tiff and Joey 😂 also did anyone notice how similar her house is to the one she made in Oasis in the Promise Land? 😮 My Cupquake geekyness is showing pffft
iHasCupquake,"As someone who loved Enchanted Oasis an unhealthy amount and had my aesthetic and younger tween years formed by it, I&#39;m overjoyed to see this."
iHasCupquake,I laughed so hard when joey asked if you&#39;re flirting with him! 🤣 im loving this witchcraft series i want more! 💕
iHasCupquake,"Hey Tiff! I don’t know if you know, but you can bone meal the mystic flowers. You can also plant the petals and use bone meal on them! I forgot if it is regular bonemeal or the floral fertilizer one!"
iHasCupquake,"you have improved so much over the years with your production styles. 10 year subscriber, thank you for everything. watching this makes me emotional."
iHasCupquake,I loved the whole interaction between you and Joey lol!! Definitely try to befriend Scott!!!💕✨💕
iHasCupquake,I feel like my life is coming full circle by watching this series. Tiffy basically raised me. I started watching her right before she started minecraft oasis. I am getting married later this year and I will 100% still be watching these videos. Until. I. Die.
iHasCupquake,"I know it isn&#39;t necessraily a unique sentiment among all the other comments you&#39;re getting like this, but this Minecraft series really makes me nostalgic. I remember religiously watching your Minecraft Oasis series when I was in middle school. Now I&#39;m about to get an undergraduate in science and I plan on moving on to medical school after that, and your videos still make me smile every time I watch them. Thank you so much for always being such a genuine and kind person who just wants to spread love and joy. I look forward to watching more of this series."
iHasCupquake,i feel so nostalgic watching an ihascupquake minecraft series! i am obsessed! the oasis play through was so important to be when it came out and it still holds a very special place in my heart. Plus the vibes from this is just so perfect
iHasCupquake,I love watching multiple perspectives of this series because then it becomes funny when you see both sides of a perspective. I can&#39;t wait to see how this all unfolds though :D
iHasCupquake,"I don&#39;t care how old I get, when Cupquake starts a Minecraft series, I HAVE to watch it. I watched Minecraft Oasis like my life depended on it when I was much younger and wanted to learn how to MOD Minecraft SO BAD because of her. This series is gonna be one to remember, I&#39;m sure. And hopefully it&#39;ll give her younger audience as much joy as Oasis brought us, just waiting for the next episode. In any case, Cupquake and Joey&#39;s interactions in this are so funny. They&#39;re like best frenemies 😂 Antagonizing each other one minute and congratulating each other the next"
iHasCupquake,"Watched tiff when I was 9, now I’m a freshman in college😭 absolutely immaculate vibes for writing my research paper thank you bestie🥰"
iHasCupquake,honestly scott and tiff could be a really cool combo. its like Life and Death. would make a really powerful duo that is super unlikely
iHasCupquake,So glad to see you’re back on Minecraft!! I can’t wait for the next episode 😄
iHasCupquake,This series is an actual gift! I can’t wait to see more and to go back and relive some of those oasis and cloud 9 memories:)
iHasCupquake,This series is so you it makes me happy that you get to incorporate your witchy interests into your content hope to see more 💕
iHasCupquake,"Loving the series, keep it up!"
iHasCupquake,I remember being super young and watching enchanted oasis and absolutely falling in love. I’ve waited years for a return like this and I’m honestly so excited 🤭🫶🏻
iHasCupquake,"watching cupquake play minecraft again makes my heart so incredibly happy. so good to see you enjoying this series as well, tiff! your happiness heals 💕"
iHasCupquake,"It&#39;s been a long time since I actively watched your videos, and it&#39;s very nostalgic to be back watching you play minecraft! Can&#39;t wait to see how things go this time."
iHasCupquake,Man I remember when I was younger I would always watch the oasis series and I loved it! I finally found your channel again after so long and I&#39;m happy to start re watching your videos! Thank you for the videos!
iHasCupquake,this series is so relaxing~ i love it
iHasCupquake,I love that Scott’s curse on Joey ended up in the video! The combustion in the sun was so funny!
iHasCupquake,"Whoo Hoo, More WitchCraft! 😃💜🖤💕💞✨🎮🎧"
iHasCupquake,"I think there&#39;s a way to farm the magical petals by planting them on the ground. Using either bonemeal or floral fertilizer (I forget which) someone in a different modpack was able to plant one petal, grow it into a tall mystical flower, and get multiple petals from it. A more sustainable way to get the petals, as long as that other modpack wasn&#39;t using an addon you don&#39;t have or a different version of the mod."
iHasCupquake,"i love how😂 the first minutes of the episode ,nothing went to tiff&#39;s desire;<br><br>&quot;i&#39;ll get more endoflowers to get more mana.... <br>wheres my mana?&quot;<br><br>&quot;let&#39;s see if our farmer here has more beetroot...<br>(sees that it wasnt even a stack of beetroot&quot;&quot;<br><br>&quot;k.. well we will visit bertha soon so... <br>*bertha left the game<br><br><br>😆"
iHasCupquake,"Really loving this series, just got back into playing Minecraft again and this is a cute companion series to that"
iHasCupquake,"I love these videos, they’re so calm and help me multi task❤😊"
iHasCupquake,"I love this series, I don’t want it to enddd💗💗"
iHasCupquake,The hilarious rabbit killing spree 😂😂<br>Another fun episode entirely ❤
iHasCupquake,"There is a flower that eats food, the more saturation the better. As you can grow crops easily this may be a better choice, also it will inately produce more mana than the endoflames. Automated, you will only need one flower.  <br>~Fade_Alchemist~"
iHasCupquake,the way i am so happy that this series is happening 😭
iHasCupquake,Love your positive attitude!Keep up the great work❤️✊🏻
iHasCupquake,not me being 20 absolutely loving this series it brings me sm happiness seeing you and joey together as well as you playing mc
iHasCupquake,you can plant the mystical petals and use bonemeal to get a flower of that color with shears (it will break if a hand is used) <br><br>you can also get the jaded amaranthus in botania which is a flower that generates mystical flowers from mana
iHasCupquake,I love this series already 💜
iHasCupquake,this series is so fun!<br>i love the art too!
iHasCupquake,Love this series so far!!❤
iHasCupquake,"i get so excited when i see the notification!! I’m loving this seriesssssss, brings back so many memories!! Keep slaying queen."

iHasCupquake,Hey! Loving the series! Takes me back to when I was 10 watching the oasis series. What mods are you currently using for this series??? 💗
iHasCupquake,Another nostalgic episode. I feel 10 again

iHasCupquake,"me and my little sister are watching the series together&lt;33 i was 10 when i first found Minecraft Oasis, so much nostalgia from this series:)"

iHasCupquake,"Haha I love how flustered Craig makes everyone. Mark, Jack, Tiff, Deli, Kelsey (Buzzfeed - no not that Kelsey).<br><br>Me too though. Craigs a dreamy dude."
iHasCupquake,Cupquake: can you explain.. memes to me?<br>Me: <b>dies of laughter</b>

iHasCupquake,"Did anyone else pray that Craig would have the baby when they went for a jog, and when you saw he had no baby on his chest you just said out loud, &quot;DAMMIT!&quot;"
iHasCupquake,"Watching this at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjN-OUT0gxg&amp;t=3m30s"">3:30</a>am!

Oh well I&#39;m a huge adrenaline junkie so there is no chance that I&#39;m getting any sleep so I&#39;ll wing it 😉 like if you&#39;re British! ♥️"
iHasCupquake,"Every time Tiffy does a a video of Dream Daddy, she should always start it with the theme song and lip sing to it, while doing cute little moves with it. Who agrees to my proposition?"
iHasCupquake,My favorites series so far!!!!!!!!!😂😂😍😍😍😍😍
iHasCupquake,"Right when I was actually tired for once, cupquake uploads PERFECT 👌"
iHasCupquake,I played the game and decided to end up with Craig. Not a bad ending! Idk whether you will get different endings if you end up with different dads...

iHasCupquake,"This game is really trippy XD this has nothing to do with the video:<br>Tiff, I have watched you for years and you have always been there for many of your subscribers, like myself when we are having any bad days. Your beauty is unreal and so is how funny you are (Funniness also goes to Red). With brown hair or purple hair, you are still the supportive, fun, funny, and pretty YouTuber who has many people supporting her. Even if you don&#39;t see this (which you may be too busy), I just wanted to say that."
iHasCupquake,"you should play this more i like <a href=""http://it.it"">it.it</a> looks cool :))) P.S love your vids"
iHasCupquake,2 things you don&#39;t have to slide to love you can just tap and you have to mostly pay attention to the dialogue or else you won&#39;t know what&#39;s going on

iHasCupquake,Cupquake idk how else to reach you cause Twitter won&#39;t do long posts. I just wanted to let you know two things <br><br>1. I&#39;m a real huge fan and have been since day one. Watching your videos help me so much . I have real bad depression and I&#39;m bipolar. I&#39;m always feeling better after hearing yours and red&#39;s voices and watching the video&#39;s. <br><br>2. My twin sister was a huge fan just like me. But recently she passed on. She&#39;s now in heaven watching you play your video games. She told me of anything ever happened to her to tell you how much you mean to her even thou you don&#39;t know her. She use to have a fan account on Facebook and a Twitter for you but I made a promise to delete all her social media&#39;s . She use to comment on your video&#39;s telling you what you meant to her and how you&#39;ve helped her. We both love you . <br><br>Idk if you&#39;ll read this but it&#39;s worth a try.
iHasCupquake,they should do a husband vs wife on this

iHasCupquake,"CupQuake,<br>I have no idea how else to say this to you, but you&#39;re so inspiring. You&#39;ve inspired me to do more of what I love (painting and art stuffs), and to be kinder to everyone I meet. I have recreated most of these, but they are no match to these masterpieces in these videos. In fact my recreations are so bad that I really need help. I have no idea how to get better and if you could give this 13 year old fan girl some tips, I would literally (figuratively) die of excitement, and will do nothing but follow those guide lines al-throughout my art. And I know you&#39;re probably super busy with stuff that you wont respond, but I believe in fate and hope and all that. So if you do happen to see this, I want you to know you have made an amazing impact on my life.<br>&lt;3   &lt;3   &lt;3   &lt;3   &lt;3"
iHasCupquake,"This is the first video of you doing a painting, You are an amazing artist! Keep up the good work!"
iHasCupquake,I actually really love how you did the eyes! Its soooo cool.
iHasCupquake,"Even if you painting wasn&#39;t speed up, I would watch the whole thing. Can your next painting please be in real time!! &lt;3"

iHasCupquake,Your paintings are amazing cupquake don&#39;t stop making these videos.
iHasCupquake,"your paintings are all FABULOUS. this ones cute too, but the eyes. they are scaring me a little. But still adorable!"
iHasCupquake,"To note- your painting videos have three times more views, and twice the love. :)"
iHasCupquake,Just a question! What part about this painting was the hardest to paint?
iHasCupquake,you make everything in minecraft look good. ill even buy a chicken if you make it.
iHasCupquake,Oh my god! you are such a good artist! how much does it cost to make one of those?!
iHasCupquake,this is something i have to say: your the best painter i have seen!
iHasCupquake,"Just wondering, do you prepare the wood in any way before you start painting?"
iHasCupquake,"Tif, I have a 2 questions for you:
1) what do you use to prime your wood?
2) what do you always use to blend?
I paint with oils on wood too, so I&#39;m just curious (:

Btw, I love it!"
iHasCupquake,BTW your an amazing artist!!!:)
iHasCupquake,You are an amazing artist Cupquake!! :D
iHasCupquake,really love this style!
iHasCupquake,Steve kindof looks possessed. Awesome painting as usual :)
iHasCupquake,"Cupquake, I have 1 question:Which kind of paint should I use? I have only used acrilic paint but I&#39;d like to know if oils are any better:) Thank you, and great video!"
iHasCupquake,"Cupquake, I&#39;m sure this has been asked... but what are you using to rub the oil into the wood, is that a wash cloth or paper towel? Thanks"
iHasCupquake,I wish I was that good of an artist as you. Good job BTW
iHasCupquake,you&#39;re an amazing artist tiff XD
iHasCupquake,"you are amazing at art/graphics, cant wait till im better at graphics when im older, but seroiusly your amazing at painting :)"
iHasCupquake,Its amazing. As always :D
iHasCupquake,Do u get those wooden planks like at a local painting store or you order on the internet? I really wanna know where to get those cause they seem very nice to paint on :)  
iHasCupquake,"In one word, AMAZING!"
iHasCupquake,Do a big landscape picture with all the mods (even squid) for the finale :D
iHasCupquake,"Awesome, as always c:"
iHasCupquake,Cupquake is like Bob Ross for video games...
iHasCupquake,"@MsNescaa
If you go to like a local craft store, like Micheals or A.C. Moore, they should have a section for unfinished wood. Just look around in that section, they will most likely have tons of different shapes, sizes, and cuts. I paint on the same kind of plaques (:"
iHasCupquake,can you do a video walk through on how you do these drawings like how you get the right colours and in general how you go about doing everything please :) and if theres a video already of that can someone please provide me with a link :) i love you all &lt;3

Youtuber,Comments
MegMage,The next quest is hands down one of the most haunting and beautiful parts of the entire game. Can&#39;t wait.
MegMage,Olgierd&#39;s third wish... I been waiting for this mission since you started this game.
MegMage,"Quinto is an easter egg. It is a reference to a Polish film &quot;Va bank&quot;, about a safecracker named Kwinto."
MegMage,"I once did a 30ish hour run, and after I laid down on bed I thought I had become a witcher myself 🤣"
MegMage,Now I can&#39;t stop imagining Caleb being sold off to Ofieri prince
MegMage,If you go back to the house where you planned the heist you will find the rest of the masks they all wore.
MegMage,"These are the wild parts of this expansion, Awesome to see you enjoying this game as well!"
MegMage,There are some interesting details you could find in the auction house One is a letter from olgierd to iris. And another detail reveals that van rogh is an alias of iris! You bought one of her paintings at the auction.
MegMage,Not Witcher related but I’d have never guessed you were a Coheed fan. When you were talking about concerts took me by surprise. Good taste in games translates to music It seems!
MegMage,Third task is most interesting task of all olgrid&#39;s task.
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqFx2-1WRqg&amp;t=1h19m57s"">1:19:57</a> I chose to fight that douche, and Geralt was true to his word; he did indeed take his head with one of the finisher moves. It was great because it wasn’t a scripted cutscene or anything, it was just lucky circumstance from gameplay :D"
MegMage,Now I wanna see someone play through the enitre game doing naught but wooden swirls.
MegMage,You definitely got one of the best outcomes for this quest.
MegMage,"For starters, if you want a lot of good herbs go back to white orchard and visit fields around the village. There is a lot of great herbs to be found including ones that are hard to find everywhere else. In many ways white orchard is the easy mode for alchemists looking to start out with a good supply. If you plan to make white gull for the superior recipes then you will need to get a certain herb and that herb is very plentiful in white orchard. With that out of the ways lets get to the heist and the road not taken. If you save the locked up thief, you will have another encounter with a familiar figure. Remember letho&#39;s friend that he left to die? That is Hans of Cidaris. Its a pity too as that same person is also linked to a nearby royal griffin contract. As for the halfling, you need not worry about him as the ermine is the best and only real option for that quest. <br><br>That brings us to olgierd and the borsodis. Honestly you made the wise decision as siding ewald saves the dwarf. Side with horst and the dwarf gets killed. Honestly I often go with quinto and horst. Horst in many ways reminds me of Siggy Reuven. They are both men with ambition and they do not mind twisting the knife on those who deserve it. As for horst and olgierd, I feel olgierd&#39;s family deserved their fate. Their fortune was derived from looting and murdering the less fortunate then using the wealth to uplift themselves. Even olgierd and his brother carried on this family tradition with happy zeal. When they tried to go legit, karma caught up to them and they lost their wealth they had robbed so many to acquire. Horst knew of this which is why he had no qualms about robbing from robbers. As a result, olgierd reaped what he sowed and begged just like so many before him had done but to no avail. It was his decision afterwards that defined his character. He turned to making deals with demons and robbing people as he had done countless times before. His own fate now is of his own making and though he often tries to evoke pity for his fate its neither something he actually wants nor deserves. You are now on to the final piece of the puzzle. A tragedy that both tugs at the soul and yet also hungrily seeks to devour it. A horror show awaits you and you best make certain you are well prepared as it is sure to be a long haul to complete this one. Just be sure to have a handkerchief handy as there is at least one soul that deserving of your pity. <br><br>I see you decided to abandon the enchantment. To each his or her own. Those who make minimal coin often balk at spending even over a 1000 coin for the simplest of things while others still think they will find something far more worthy of their coin. Its a tough choice and not many decide to make the decision to invest. I suggest you decide on your own and not let chat dictate if its worth it or not. It is your playthrough so I shall leave that decision up to you."
MegMage,At the auction you bought one of the best witcher sets. I think it&#39;s worth creating it. :))
MegMage,I think that heist went about as good as it could :D There are definitely much worse outcomes... Well played ^^
MegMage,"Damn, the nerve of Meg saying “The best villains are those where you can say ‘I can’t sympathize with what you’re doing, but I can see how you got there’ “, after seeing the Bloody Baron as a pretty one-dimensional villain…"
MegMage,Im not sure for 100% but I think If you would choose Quinto (instead of Casimir) he would betray and help Horst in the vault so the dwarf is the good choice and im not sure but If you kill both Borsodi&#39;s the auction house will be bought by Vimme Vivaldi
MegMage,"Just did this quest yesterday lol, it’s a great one"
MegMage,is that Olgierd&#39;s sword? how did she get that?
MegMage,"I mean, is it that surprising that Geralt doesn&#39;t want to kill people during a heist? He usually does it to defend himself or to save someone."
MegMage,lol I love the random moral objection about killing in just this one quest...
MegMage,"Meg <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqFx2-1WRqg&amp;t=1h08m18s"">1:08:18</a> you can see Gaunter O’ Dim to the right of the negotiation guard. 😈"
MegMage,English voice of Geralt is mostly compared to Batman Style Voice. It&#39;s not far from truth but not exactly also
MegMage,cant wait for blood and wine :D
MegMage,"hey meg, i loved your videos! will you play yakuza series one day? i think it will be fun😄"
MegMage,Awesome 🙀
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqFx2-1WRqg&amp;t=15m19s"">15:19</a> DON&#39;T DRO-<br>ah"
MegMage,I really want to tell you where is the second diagram of the Viper sword but I&#39;d spoil some things<br><br>I just hope someone will/did tell you on Live because that&#39;s just once chance to get it
MegMage,Meg I wanted to watch your twitch stream and now it says available to subscribers only ?!!! Why?😳
MegMage,"Stream playthroughs are the worst, always missing half the dialog and cutscenes staring at chat and message notifications"
MegMage,Trump supporters 😂
MegMage,"Trump supporters, I see. Not watching this channel again"
MegMage,Aloy gets criticism for being too boring but I adore her. She&#39;s understated and soft spoken but her confidence and drive speaks volumes.
MegMage,"I&#39;m 20 hours in and this game is amazing. They have taken evrything from Zero Dawn and made it better. I&#39;m really impressed by all the different charcater models and their animation, they all just look like real people"
MegMage,"Aloy running away from a party because she&#39;s scared all that attention. She is such a introvert 🤗 . . . That is so funny to me.  . . . I love her though, she&#39;s intelligent and physically talented &quot;beautiful and adorable💗"
MegMage,Nice to see you did what I did and listened to the entire theme on the title screen before starting the game. 😎
MegMage,"I&#39;m so excited to watch you play this! Specially because this is the only way that I&#39;ll be able to play for a WHILE, since I don&#39;t own a PS5 or even a PS4 anymore. I love the story of the first game SO MUCH, and Ted Faro may be my most hated villain ever. So yeah, I can&#39;t wait to watch you play and to see where the story goes!"
MegMage,Glad to see you are playing Horizon Forbidden West I got it on exactly the same day it got released. I absolutely loved Zero Dawn finished it a couple of times. I am 40 hours in with Forbidden West the game is freaking amazing I am doing literally every single thing in the game that is why I am now only on 25% game completion lol I love hunting machines for metal shards. Even on PS4 Pro this Forbidden West looks amazing.
MegMage,I cannot believe I’ve just discovered you. I’ve been looking for a perfect gameplay of horizon forbidden west and I finally found You! I love that you explore so much and I love your vibe as well :”) I will definitely be staying here hehe
MegMage,Yesssssssss!!!!!!! So excited for this playthrough! 🥳 I’m loving the game so far ❤️
MegMage,"damn, it&#39;s been a long time since Horizon Zero Dawn but here it is.<br><br>Aloy is back!!!<br><br>I started this few days ago and it&#39;s such a treat.<br><br>nice to see someone who plays this with full interest and emotional attachment.<br><br>btw, there are character bios in the main menu where you can read... well bios for character and data which are still important for the full lore :)<br><br>PS5 version is SOOOO good.<br><br>the controller is amazing and fluidity is great."
MegMage,"Awesome , I&#39;m already deep into watching this playthrough and your happiness and excitement from playing this game is so infectious it&#39;s putting a smile on my face lol  , I can&#39;t wait to play this game when I get my copy soon 😊🙌🤘🔥🔥🔥"
MegMage,Speaking Classics Dino Crisis is right next to Tomb Raider an Resident evil.<br>      Regina is military trained and literal brains of the team.<br><br>  Gale is all Bravado.<br>   Rick is either in his computer or wanting to safe everyone.<br><br>  Regina literally handles business.<br>       She is very graceful too.
MegMage,I was so so exited to see this video come up because I have been wanting to check forbidden west out but I don’t have a ps4 anymore. The next best thing (or something arguably better) is watching someone awesome like Meg play through it :)
MegMage,My favorite game series!<br><br> Hope no one spoils it for you on stream. Some have been doing that online.<br><br> I got the Regalla collectors edition and have really been enjoy9ng it. So glad to hear the first game had such a huge impact on you! <br><br>Will definitely be watching these vods as I play through myself.
MegMage,"Fantastic gameplay walkthrough i really enjoyed and liked it keep it up your doing absolutely Great job :3 <br>I love your videos , i love watching them good job ! <br>Have a great day 🙂"
MegMage,"That pterodactyl scream at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VOcrvXNzkM&amp;t=15m40s"">15:40</a> made me burst out laughing. XD"
MegMage,"Honestly, I like that a lot in games.<br>        I think every game dude that start off playing video games, will have fond memories.<br><br>   Playing as a heroine in a horror an/or epic fantasy.<br>       Or complete bombshells in the game Die or Alive🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😉🙃😌🤗Thank you Japan for that game."
MegMage,Love this game so much I want to get it this week I am loving it so far Hope you can do more in 2022
MegMage,"I am loving the game so far, and I loved the first one."
MegMage,"my memory of the first time I got interested in games with story development was with Chrono Cross, in the old ps1 era 1998/1999😆, since then they are my favorites.  I wrote while watching, I still haven&#39;t seen everything but it&#39;s very good!"
MegMage,"I&#39;m have  the &quot;PS5 Special Edition. So I&#39;m playing this as well,but I had watch you and experience this with you. Very exciting and fun episode &quot;Meg🌟🙌"
MegMage,"One important  tip after watching stream: on the machine codex in your notebook,  you can highlight what each component on the machine does and see what component gives what resources,  and what attack or function it disables on the machine.  Just use left and right on the d pad and it will sort through them all in the top right of the machines codex page. It&#39;s easier to memorize and don&#39;t have to rely as much on the focus tagging in heat of combat. The slitherfang has like 20 pieces!"
MegMage,"Final Fantasy 12 an 9.<br>    Have very dynamic women.<br>          Amalia in FF12 is both Queen, Princess, Warrior, Widow, last of her dynasty, from the Wraith Wall Bloodline.<br><br>     You literal support her journey of growth as a person an character.<br>       You an ragtag crew of very human characters too."
MegMage,"I totally agree with you on the &quot;it doesn&#39;t even matter that she&#39;s a woman&quot; point. Most of the time with female protagonists in TV and gaming it&#39;s &quot;this female hero&quot; or &quot;the hero we all needed!&quot; and they try to stick feminist believes up your throat that make you roll your eyes sometimes (take the supergirl show on the CW as an example they&#39;ve said &quot;she&#39;s just a girl, no she&#39;s a woman!&quot; so many times I lost count AND THAT WAS ONY IN THE FIRST EPISODE.<br><br>With Aloy however I&#39;ve barely heard them mention that she&#39;s a woman, they turned the words &quot;A female hero&quot; and turned it into &quot;A hero who happens to be female&quot;.<br>I honestly don&#39;t even know where I want to go with this point but you get what I mean xd"
MegMage,Heavenly Sword is a classic.<br>     It is a very Shakespearean videogame.
MegMage,Why do more streamers not play this game …it’s super strange
MegMage,Ooh aloy is back 🌟<br>Our girl favorite warrior is champion ❤️
MegMage,Horizon Zero dawn was my first story game too <br>I was 12 years old then and it changed me till now 😂
MegMage,Hi MegMage I Hope you are having a wonderful day today 😎👍 And you are the Awesomeness YouTuber and Person Ever 😎😃👍
MegMage,yeah i just got my copy of this game today and we will go for one hell of a ride haha
MegMage,Alien syndrome.<br>   Is another game.<br>  With a dynamic character build up story.<br>        Yes the character is a woman.
MegMage,AAAAAAAAAA I DIDNT KNOW YOU PLAYED FORBIDDEN WEST! I LOVED ZERO DAWN SO MUCH AND I LOVE YOUR CONTENT SO MUCH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
MegMage,just started playing this and got stuck 20 min in 😂
MegMage,You are awesome :)
MegMage,"Wet the videogame;  the anti hero heroine is bounty hunter🥰🥰so cool.<br>   Beyond 2 Souls, is totally very submersive."
MegMage,meg dyeing her hair red in 3 2 1...
MegMage,Martian Gothic unification.<br>   Resident Evil.<br>   Also have have women as leaders.<br>    <br>I miss both video because the intro musics are sick as hell.
MegMage,"This is just the cliff of a deeper iceberg in game history.<br>       Honestly they got to have a variety of women in videogames; I bought bayonetta the videogame, over lead dude games every time.<br><br>     Well, I am dude; I do not want to play a game looking at a dude for a month straight.<br><br>Unless there is a reason an exception.<br>     Kratos, Doomguy, Shepherd, Master-chief, Gabriel Belmont."
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VOcrvXNzkM&amp;t=15m41s"">15:41</a> 🤣 . . . Damn gurL you&#39;re so damn funny 😂"
MegMage,That is just videogames as a kid you can play; 😌😉😑💯😏There is wealth of culture for cultured connoisseurs of gaming for men an women.<br>     As Palatine will say: &quot;The jedi will consider unnatural.&quot;
MegMage,"I used to have games from the 90s to 2020, not including my Dad&#39;s games from back in the day like....Doom😑☺☠🤩starring the doom guy.<br><br>      Women have a very vibrant role in videogames."
MegMage,Samus Metroid.<br>   For starts.<br>   Let alone the silent hill series.
MegMage,Yeaaaahhhh!!!! I can watch the vods I completely forgot about the YouTube side!
MegMage,That intro music 😍😍😍
MegMage,I wish I could play this game myself but I just don&#39;t have a ps
MegMage,"Is it just me or does the Protagonist look like her? <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VOcrvXNzkM&amp;t=11m04s"">11:04</a> Lol"
MegMage,I love this game and l love you
MegMage,did you record your hzd playthrough?
MegMage,I love you!
MegMage,"Tomb Raider.<br>    Nightshade 2, with Hibbana.<br> Mirror Edge.<br>     Are more games.<br>  [Yes, I played a lot of video games with women as leads; 🤷🏿‍♂️I am guy an guilty of being bias]."
MegMage,I love youuuu hhhh😘❤️
MegMage,Stan Lee continues to bring joy and happiness to many even after his passing. What a legend
MegMage,"Stan lee is the reason I grew up watching Spider-Man , everything he created it just like he is really here . Rest In Peace legend 🙏🏻✊🏻"
MegMage,I love how MJ and Peter are shown here. You don&#39;t see exes being portrayed so amicably in media very often. :) <br>I think they borrowed her being a reporter for the Bugle from the  recent Spiderman cartoons. <br>Staaaaan ;_;
MegMage,That hit me hard too 🥺 I played it right after Stan Lee passed
MegMage,This series is months old and I just started it today haha. The urge to tell you that whenever u see those circles on edges or platforms u want to stealth on u just press the left and right trigger to zip to it is HARD to fight LMAO
MegMage,Stan Lee. you will be missed always. may you continue to R.I.P.
MegMage,"I really wanted to meet Stan, cause like Kevin Conroy; he was my hero, it broke me when I heard of his passing and I didn&#39;t have the words 😢 I still miss him, even thought I didn&#39;t get the chance to meet him and I will love Marvel and Dc Characters forever and ever"
MegMage,"First off stan we miss you man, secondly I find it to funny how meg beats the shit out of the demons but struggles against the thugs 😆. Loving everyone your spidey playtroughs. There so good i get depressed when the videos over. Maybe I&#39;ll redownload twitch to watch more."
MegMage,<b>me playing a million different games remembering all controller functions</b> 👁👄👁
MegMage,I&#39;m sorry but I would be so offended if spider-man told me &quot;I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t help you I&#39;m taking a picture of something&quot;
MegMage,Rip Stan lee 😖
MegMage,Hi how are you?:3 good job i love the video keep it up i can&#39;t wait to see more of u :3
MegMage,i love you 3000 stan lee ♥♥♥♥ :(
MegMage,still crying
MegMage,"Excelsior! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVC7Wf-NxIc&amp;t=56m52s"">56:52</a>"
MegMage,Have you took a look at the other Spidy&#39;s suits
MegMage,Demons are cool thank you very much
MegMage,Don&#39;t cry please you broken my heart when you crying you are so cute I love you so much 😍 😍 😍 😍 have a good day 😊 😊 😊 I love you so much 😍 😍 😍 you are so cute and beautiful 😍 😍
MegMage,"harleen is the perfect origin story, I love it so much 👌😍"
MegMage,Hey meg! I just wanted to tell you I&#39;ve been Absolutely LOVING your playthrough on the Arkham games can&#39;t stop binge watching your amazing content and I just really love how you stop and look at the riddles. Your definitely my favorite yt channel and I can&#39;t wait for more content! I hope your really having fun playing these amazing Batman games and am excited to see your reactions and playthroughs on more Batman!
MegMage,"Really like the Mad Hatter segment, so different from any other environment in the game.  I only wish it was longer.<br>The martial arts fighters can be hard to handle at first.  The double counter sign indicates you have to hit the button twice or they&#39;ll counter your counter, and the spin kicks do a lot of damage.  You can still mess them up with Explosive Gel or Concussion Detonator.  Luckily they aren&#39;t too common, at least on the <b>Normal</b> difficulty..."
MegMage,"Evade is the key to movement and mastering the game&#39;s combat mechanics. <br><br>Hit once, then use evade to move to another enemy. And keep repeating the process. Once you get the hang of it, it minimizes your enemies opportunities to hit you."
MegMage,"Don&#39;t forget you can do a quick batarang by just tapping the trigger to help hit enemies that are farther away from you that are shooting at you. Also, don&#39;t forget to tilt the directional stick when attacking when your combo is 3 or higher to do leaping attacks towards enemies that are farther away"
MegMage,We want more parts to this ! Lol what&#39;s Meg gonna do? Glasses or no glasses? Find out in the next episode ! LOL Mad Hatter is darker. The Animated Series made him tolerable but this game showed a dark side !
MegMage,"Follow the White Rabbit. Plus to keep your combo up you have to steer your punches towards the thugs, don&#39;t forget at x8 the combo glows yellow and special combo takedowns can instantly take down thugs in one move the controls are B + Y"
MegMage,"OMG I didn&#39;t know you read Harleen! It&#39;s one of my fave comics! The same author was supposed to do one for Poison Ivy as well called Isley, unfortunate it was discontinued. Comic book review of it soon? 🙂"
MegMage,Probably should have quick fired the batarangs at the lanterns in the mad hatter mission.
MegMage,Level environment reminds of alice:madness returns a lot. Good game btw
MegMage,Finally caved and subbed both in patreon and here coz I can&#39;t wait for more Batman content 😀<br><br>Just a heads up when you watch Long Haloween Part 1 there&#39;s a small end credits scene that gives a little bit of context before you watch Part 2 so you might want to watch that part.
MegMage,"harleen is AMAZING, such a great book."
MegMage,I noticed in this episode every single combat scenario you were punching the crim8nla sto the moon 😂 sometimes the physics isn’t this game can be a little.. wacky.
MegMage,You can also use your quick fire gadgets to add that Batman swag
MegMage,"One trick that&#39;s useful when you&#39;ve got one or two guys with guns in a close combat fight is to throw a batarang or use the batclaw on them. The batarang will stun them for a moment, while the claw will either pull them off-balance or (if you have the right upgrade) pull the gun from their hands."
MegMage,"Hey Meg, Sep 17 today is Batman Day! Is there any new Batman content for us? 😁"
MegMage,Use your special combo attack to instantly take down enemies. It helps and it increases xp points for combat.
MegMage,Curious you mentioned the Harleen comic because I adored that comic as well especially the art style! Are you going to do a comic review of it like you did Batman Year One? Would be interested to hear more of your thoughts on it.
MegMage,Love you and love your games ❤❤
MegMage,to counter 3 enemies at once you have to click triangle 3 times
MegMage,Dunno why they added the concussion detonator when it&#39;s useless in this game tbh
MegMage,You can stun the big guy brutes by pressing the stun button three times. They never actually tell you that in game for some reason.
MegMage,"For the martial artists you have to counter them a few times in a row, attacking them  at the beginning of  a combo will always hurt you unless you manage to knock them on the ground."
MegMage,"It was really good. I think you should watch the Spider-Man animated series too ,it also not bad and interesting."
MegMage,You should read the latest Riddler Batman one shot comic by Tom King and Mitch Gerards. It’s part of a series of one shots called One Bad Day.
MegMage,"Don’t worry about getting the Evade (double x) thing perfect right away. It’s just a way to get higher combos and avoid damage. Just think attack, dodge, attack, dodge, and it’ll start to make sense. It just takes practice like anything else."
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz5kGkYwY98&amp;t=0m54s"">0:54</a> Shit. The cop phase shifted through the building."
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz5kGkYwY98&amp;t=38m25s"">38:25</a> The ole glitchy triple knockdown."
MegMage,"You have a list of the Batman animated movies you’ll be seeing? &amp; I like that all of the villains least the ones Batman faces in DC all have some sort of mental problem. Mad Hatter , Joker, Riddler jsut interesting to see what kinds of stories they can come up with"
MegMage,follow the White rabbit
MegMage,Meg please react to ragnarok story trailer please it&#39;s out now
MegMage,PLEASE PLAY ARKHAM KNIGHT... IM BEGGING YOU!!!!!!!!!!!
MegMage,The Witcher taught us not to judge a book by it&#39;s cover. He turns out to be the most charming little fellow.
MegMage,“Don’t be afraid”<br>Geralt was ABSOLUTELY talking to you Meg ❤️
MegMage,"This is just the &quot;dad&#39;s not wanting then loving the adopted animal&quot; meme, but, in video games lol"
MegMage,The duality of no
MegMage,"The way the &quot;No&quot; seems to mean one thing one moment, and then a totally different thing the next, is just throughly entertaining. I can&#39;t get over it 😆 <br><br>Probably because my reaction was similar"
MegMage,😂 😂 I’m subbing Jus cus of her reaction she fitna make me replay witcher 3
MegMage,"Just picked this game up again after 4 years. First it played on the PS4, kinda just mindlessly played through it without grasping the story. Now gonna go through it on PC with a fresh mind lol."
MegMage,"... then, Meg&#39;s gonna get very mad!"
MegMage,"Ringworm! Rubbish! Bumblebee! Flabbergasted! Oh, the sound of it!"
MegMage,Thank you so much you made my day
MegMage,One of my fav character in Witcher 3 the second he showed up he instantly became my favorite.
MegMage,LITERALLY ME.
MegMage,Should do another Johnny &#39;then and now&#39; on Bald Mountain 😁
MegMage,"you should read the books, most complex fantasy world/story ever created"
MegMage,Ive only had johnny for 2 hrs but if anything happens to him....
MegMage,No
MegMage,Hey my name is Jonny lol
MegMage,"So why the first &quot;no, no no&quot; reaction? Didn&#39;t really get it :D"
MegMage,On what platform you are playing ?? If it it xbox plssss add me
MegMage,Haytham absoloutely schooled Connor with that rooftop speech
MegMage,"It&#39;s always a weird moment when Haytham just outright says &quot;He is my son&quot; to the other Templars. <br><br>No hesitation, no trying to justify anything. You really do get the sense that even though he absolutely despises the concept of the Assassins; there is some genuine fatherly pride of Connor inside him. It&#39;s fascinating to watch."
MegMage,"I’m glad she’s playing the Homestead missions, they give Connor so much more depth than just being Mr. “What would you have me do?”"
MegMage,Yea haytham is definitely well written I love the dynamic between him and Connor
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhL1sBu5dbg&amp;t=1h10m30s"">1:10:30</a> Easily one of the funniest moments ever. One excuse for Connor to tackle his dad. <br><br>Haytham: &quot;Oh. No... there&#39;s no way of knowing what&#39;s on-the-other SI-!!!!&quot;<br><br>*Loading screen<br><br>Haytham: &quot;-iiiiiddddeee!!&quot;<br><br>*splash. 😂😂😂😂"
MegMage,I like how Meg left Haytham waiting in New York for a couple months
MegMage,"I have to say it... The Homestead Missions are some of my Favorite AC Content, just with all the build Up and Payoffs they give you"
MegMage,"You’re absolutely right, Haytham is such a well-written character and the best antagonist in the franchise.<br>He got the backstory, the charisma and the intention."
MegMage,Fantastic job with the nearly perfect stealth run on that fort. I’m impressed!
MegMage,"You say when we look at the homestead we see humans are capable of some kind of freedom and order, but majority of the homestead missions are chaotic and if you think about it the community wouldn&#39;t exist if it wasn&#39;t specifically for connor maintaining order.<br><br> Which means the community wouldn&#39;t exist or would fall apart if it did not have anyone (connor) there to maintain peace and order."
MegMage,"My man haytham is my fav character in AC3,  infact he maybe for me in top 5 ac characters"
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhL1sBu5dbg&amp;t=56m19s"">56:19</a> Haythem actually cared about Connor a lot more than he ever let on. When Connor asked why Haythem didn&#39;t kill him when they first met, Haythem didn&#39;t want to answer. He brushed it off as curiosity and tried to change the subject. The real reason was that he wanted to know what it was like to have a son and deep down, he still hoped there was a way for him and Connor to find some sort of common ground. Haythem actually has a lot of respect for Connor and holds him in pretty high regard, he&#39;s just too proud to show it."
MegMage,I honestly am so excited to see more of these videos from Meg. I love seeing new players slowly fall in love with the series. The older series&#39; definitely needs more love.
MegMage,Assassin&#39;s Creed III is my favourite Assassin&#39;s Creed game. Not only do I love the Haytham-Connor duo but that it was the first game in which the whole Assassin-Templar conflict was not set in a black and white setting but rather grey. It made me question sometimes what I was fighting for since Haytham brought up some really valid points and the fact that you thought at the beginning you were playing for the &#39;good guys&#39; when you were really playing the Templars that were shown in a positive light for the first part of the game.
MegMage,To understand Haytham is to know.. he suffered greatly. And was severely betrayed.. in the years connor was becoming an assassin. It&#39;s why he became so cold hearted. Truth is i sympathize with haytham as much as connor. Maybe even a bit more.
MegMage,"Hey Meg, love the hair! Since you&#39;re planning on playing Liberation, might I suggest trying the three Chronicles games as well, they&#39;re really underrated imo. Not massive open-world adventures like you&#39;re used to with AC though, more like linear side-scrollers with ninja-like shit and gorgeous visuals set in China, India and Russia (all places that have rich enough history to warrant having a whole trilogy just for themselves, but oh well, what can you do). Oh, and Shao Jun from Embers is the protagonist in the China one. And she has hidden blades in her soles like the fucking Kingsmen... Yeah, she&#39;s pretty freaking badass."
MegMage,I wore the Captain Outfit to the wedding. Seems like the most formal thing Connor owns.
MegMage,The book reveals Haytham already knew Zio was dead. He was feigning shock to manipulate Connor
MegMage,"I think Haytham is not actually privileged, and i think his disdain for the general populace and their lack of agency and a need to follow someone comes from a different place. None of that is really shown in the game tho, it is hinted at in AC 4, Rogue and is the whole of AC:Forsaken book. Let&#39;s just say Haytham had a ROUGH childhood and many many daddy issues, so his relationship with Connor is just an endless vicious cycle.<br><br>I also feel as tho Haytham, due to his undeniable intelligence has no patients for stupidity, and he&#39;s truly convinced that what he&#39;s doing is for the greater good, he truly is a hero of his story. As he said, he doesn&#39;t feign affection, he simply is convinced that him leading this poor nation would be hte best outcome for them, because Washington is incompetent to him and the others are just cheap greedy bastards who choose only those sides that they see as winners in the end (like Church). Of course, the error of his ways is that arrogance itself, and him believing that taking away people&#39;s freedom would save them from themselves. Many great dictators of the past who were remembered as great rulers (those exceptions did occur believe it or not...) were also of similar mindsets and there have been amazing leaders who, even through dictatorship, kept their people safe and happy. The problem is that there always comes a Ceaser and a disaster afterwards... As Haytham said, Templars only need the world to be as is, because he believes people are EAGER to idolize individuals, to follow cult leaders and worship men with charisma and competence to boot, and in AC lore it is a quite literal truth of the origin of Humanity, being  created as a slave work force by Those Who Came Before and only later on rebeling and forming their own civilization. It&#39;s also a very cool commentary on AI in our age, since many Sci-Fi authors going all the way back to 1920s and Asimov theorized about the &quot;What ifs&quot; of AI and humans playing &quot;God&quot;. Humans in AC are kind of the AI we might eventually develop, which i find really interesting....<br><br>It&#39;s kind of a shame that games after this one and Black Flag kind of ditched the whole nuance of the story for the sake of appealing to masses and printing money... These games imo tell the most profound story I have seen in gaming, fully original and utilizing wonderfully the medium it&#39;s set in, as you have brilliantly deduced that Desmond is in fact us! But Ubisoft as a company had different plans, and as a long time fan I can only dream of what could have been if Patrice wasn&#39;t fired or if Darby took over and finished the story proper (he was the lead writer for Revelations and Black Flag, the best!). <br><br>Cheers, I love these videos and I LOVE how much you&#39;re catching on your first playhtrough, truly impressive, AC 3 has a lot of storytelling with body language, hints at the bigger politics at play and character dynamics and you seem to be on point with all of it! I remember how confused people were about the whole dynamic between Washington, Haytham and Connor when this came out. People genuinely belived that the red coats are Templars for some reason, when in this time period both groups are actually small and just working in the dark behind the scenes and toying with both sides to get what they want...."
MegMage,Don&#39;t know why Connor Captain&#39;s outfit when he is on the Aquila look slick but when he is on land the outfit looks goofy af 🤣🤣🤣
MegMage,I&#39;m glad they made a game were you can play as a native american
MegMage,"Lol another reason why Connor always seemed not as quality to me... He makes no sense, all preaching peace then massacring people over something that doesnt seem that important without any attempted diplomacy. Bit of a psycho... Even though hes not meant to be seen that way. Ezio was a consistent character.<br><br>Nobody changed their outfit for the wedding... 🙁😂"
MegMage,Hello Meg:<br>Assassin&#39;s Creed Great YEAH!!!!<br>Watching and enjoying right now<br>and have a beautiful weekend<br>until your video Thank You.<br>⚔️🗡️🗡️🛡️🗡️🗡️⚔️
MegMage,"When I played AC3 being introduced to Haytham I knew it was going to be fantastic, when the realisation I had to play as Conner I stopped playing, knew assassins creed was dead and I proceeded to never play another AC game again, I was right ✅️"
MegMage,Waiting for you to get to Black Flag! 🤘
MegMage,Haythem is just a angry sassy Englishmen
MegMage,I recommend playing rouge after this.
MegMage,It doesn&#39;t matter how many times i see them but i&#39;m a sucker for the community and found family tropes it&#39;s not even funny
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhL1sBu5dbg&amp;t=30m29s"">30:29</a> You good bro?"
MegMage,"Hey Meg, please please would you play The Legend of Dragoon next? Please?"
MegMage,&quot;iiiide.&quot;
MegMage,I love your reaction to the Identity Theft side mission. I remember when you first initially thought it was Clayface but then after watching this finding out that it&#39;s actually Thomas Elliot aka Hush. He is such an interesting character to look into especially in the comics. I always love his face reveal in this game and how he killed people and finding out he used parts of his victim&#39;s faces to make himself look identical to Bruce Wayne as well as even sounding just like him too. I&#39;m so glad you reacted to some of the side missions (at least the ones you didn&#39;t complete).
MegMage,Could you consider reacting to Arkham City interview tapes? They give great insight on Arkhamverse Batman villains.
MegMage,So does this mean Meg that since you dont do a 100% complete of all side mission that you watch all side missions in the games so you do get the full experience except you aren&#39;t playing everything through yourself?
MegMage,These games are like a leather jacket. Timeless🦇
MegMage,Fun fact Hush/Thomas Elliot aka Identity Thief is voiced by Kevin Conroy just like Batman is.
MegMage,"Would you be interested in playing the Batman Telltale versions or As Dusk Falls (not Batman related)? I&#39;ve been playing As Dusk Falls and it&#39;s been pretty good, would def recommend."
MegMage,Wow that&#39;s awesome Batman Arkham 🤘🎇
MegMage,You skipped a pretty big part of the Hush / Identity Thief mission.
MegMage,"If you got the time, and are looking to build more knowledge of DC and Marvel, I recommend the YouTube channel Comic Pop. Best comics channel on YouTube. I definitely wouldn&#39;t have found some of my favorite comics without them."
MegMage,Chicken man or batman. eh That reminds me of when deadpool met black talon. Look it up and get ready for some laughs. That would make for an awesome playthrough if you can find a copy of it. Deadpool the game.
MegMage,Type in batman arkham city killer croc easter egg also calendar man 🧐
MegMage,Are you trying kratos third wife ok a new goddess of war is coming 😂😂😂😂😂 gow 6
MegMage,Play the younger even more dynamic Kratos and you will fall in love 😁😁  I think in Gow3 you will marry him  🤣
MegMage,Megmage ❤️ kratos
MegMage,i don’t blame her
MegMage,That is is not a dad bod that is a father figure
MegMage,Every time I hear “The Slopes of Blessure” I wanna replay B&amp;W again😢it’s so beautiful
MegMage,"‘A pretty dream,’ said Yennefer, stroking him lightly on the shoulder. ‘A<br>home. A house built with your own hands, and you and I in that house"
MegMage,"It&#39;s not the size of the boat that matters, but the motion of the ocean"
MegMage,This dlc made me want to own a vineyard I don’t even drink wine but I need one after this game
MegMage,I like how the first minute is just silently jamming to the soundtrack. SO relatable. 🎶
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIoB9uBAoIU&amp;t=7m00s"">7:00</a> Could you imagine if Yen was like, P.S. Tell me about what happened with Shani, we ran into each other and she said something about a lovely boat ride lol"
MegMage,"Geralt, Batman, and the Madalorian are all my favorite “emotionless” and amazing fathers. Love looks different on different kinds of people. Just because it’s not typical, doesn’t mean its not real."
MegMage,Ahhh this might be my favorite episode of your playthrough! I felt exactly the same as you uncovering the renovations etc. especially after realizing how huge and beautiful toussaint is. So good!!! You’re bringing me back to 2017!!
MegMage,"If you need some direction this early in the DLC, know that it pays to Turn And Face The Strange as soon as possible. The main quest with hunting the beast can wait.<br>Reginald&#39;s jewels give you unlimited stamina outside of combat for a while, so you can sprint forever. Make sure to return to the big statue in town (not the small one at Corvo Bianco) every once in a while.<br>Sleeping in your own bed at Corvo Bianco will give you several buffs, so you should at least buy the bed for now. The better it is, the more buffs you get. Other improvements to the estate may also add to those buffs.<br><br>My conspiracy theory about CP2077 is that it launched as a Beta test, which is why they left so much stuff easily accessible (including an excessive amount of loot) because they needed metrics on how to best optimize items&#39; distribution and access based on how people play the game."
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIoB9uBAoIU&amp;t=1h01m24s"">1:01:24</a> As for whether or not Witchers have feelings, I&#39;ve never had any doubts about that. They do. This &quot;Witchers have no emotions&quot; is a myth spread largely by &quot;Monstrum, or a Portrayal of Witchers&quot;<br>(an anonymous piece of hate literature which purports to be about Witchers), but even the Witchers themselves used this myth at times when it was convenient for them, i.e. when they had to negotiate contract rates and didn&#39;t want people to try to pay less than they should or when it was necessary to actually talk about feelings, because for a long time Geralt didn&#39;t know how to talk about them. A Shard of Ice is a great short story that shows this. He then instead of confessing his feelings for Yen hid behind this myth and called himself a mutant stripped of feelings, while the truth is that he feels emotions and is often even more humane than &quot;normal&quot; people.<br>Also, if the Witchers didn&#39;t have emotions then they wouldn&#39;t have that moral dilemma and Geralt would have no problem staying neutral, because even though he tried, in the end he always interfered in situations where there was some injustice happening. Also, there are many moments in the books where it&#39;s clear that he has feelings just like everyone else, for example, when he is afraid for Ciri it is mentioned that his hands are literally shaking, or when he thought that Yennefer was dead he almost fainted and wanted to die with her, and even wanted to commit suicide in one of the stories because he thought Yennefer didn&#39;t want him.. He loved her so much that he would rather die than live in a world without her. And he also loved Ciri as his own daughter....There&#39;s also a scene at the end of the books where he cries.<br>&quot;Geralt and Yennefer took advantage of the opportunity for a moment of intimacy. Undressing only as much as was absolutely necessary, they made love on a sheepskin coat flung onto the ground. They made love hurriedly and with abandon, in silence, without a word. <br>They made love quickly and haphazardly. Just to have more of it.<br>And when they had both calmed down, trembling and <b>kissing away each other’s tears</b> , they were greatly surprised how much happiness such hurried lovemaking had brought them.&quot; <br>This moment dispels the myth that Witchers can&#39;t cry. So yeah, if he had no emotions none of these moments would have happened...<br>And Geralt is not &quot;special&quot; when it comes to having emotions, other Witchers have them too, for example - Coen, he was also not indifferent to what happens around him. I&#39;m referring to that moment at Kaer Morhen where Triss talks about the war and urges the Witchers to get involved. Coen moved by her speech, goes to war, in which he ultimately dies because he wasn&#39;t just an empty, unfeeling monster slayer. He cared.<br>So yes, all Witchers have feelings but they often hide them because life&#39;s easier that way"
MegMage,The best way i can describe the Blood and Wine soundtrack? Think &quot;Walking through the streets of Paris&quot; meets &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; 💙
MegMage,Still crying about Roach&#39;s stable.
MegMage,Don&#39;t forget about grandmaster armorer.his skill is beyond all of crafter
MegMage,Toussaint is my favourite video game location ever! I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re enjoying  Blood and Wine and how beautiful Toussaint is.
MegMage,"An interesting detail is, if you chose to stay alone, you ll still get this letter from Yenniffer"
MegMage,"I recommend not leaving Toussaint until all Corvo Bianco renovations are complete. If you&#39;re not in Toussaint when the upgrades are done, you will not see the results when you return.. and it&#39;s permanent, meaning that any upgrades you do after will also not show up.<br><br>(supposedly fixed in the latest patch but I still had the bug)"
MegMage,"The music on this dlcis amazing, it fits perfectly"
MegMage,"One of the best DLCs, even better than some actual games (personal opinion)."
MegMage,"The one thing (among many) that I hated about the Netflix show was the music. There wasn&#39;t really anything that set the atmosphere or got you hyped up like &quot;silver for monsters&quot; did. Not to nerd out or anything, but just hearing the beginning of this video brought back a flood of memories. It&#39;s just so damn beautiful."
MegMage,"I would certainly recommend the Manticore armor, its gorgeous, and very Toussaint"
MegMage,"It was the first stream I caught and watched for a bit in person and it was so funny omg, ehehe. I don&#39;t regret not sleeping that night <br><br>Also could be described as chaotic way to Geralt&#39;s house while being interrupted every 100 steps.<br><br>Made me open W3 again and speedrun straight to Toussaint tho 🥺🌟"
MegMage,"This map probably has my favorite tracks out of the entire soundtrack honestly, especially that main one you hear in town, so good. And of course stroke Sir Reginald&#39;s balls, why wouldn&#39;t Geralt do it after all that? I invest in building up my Vinyard first, because it&#39;s Geralt and Roach&#39;s home, plus once it&#39;s built up completely you&#39;ll get Stat boosts for damn near everything after sleeping there"
MegMage,"I can see that you liked the soundtrack, so after finishing the game, I highly recommend watching a concert of music from The Witcher 3 live! <br><br>- Video Game Show - The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Concert 1080p    (over 2 million views, I don&#39;t want to post a link because YT doesn&#39;t like links in the comments)<br><br>So many emotions caused by music in one movie, something incredibly beautiful! <br>You have to watch it, even offline, for yourself.<br><br>Peace :)"
MegMage,"I have 5 playthroughs of this game, and this is the first time I&#39;ve seen it rain in Toussaint!"
MegMage,"Ah yes, Reginald’s balls, the best quest in the whole game"
MegMage,"Which difficulty do you use for Gwent, the default (normal) or the hard? If the former, I would suggest trying out the other, it could give you some (not too much though) challenges for you. As a fellow Gwent gambler I only play at the hard."
MegMage,Slopes of blessure and Fields of Ard Skellige = eargasm
MegMage,If you want the final armour sets you have a lot of money grinding to do.
MegMage,"Can&#39;t wait you to react the witcher 10 year anniversary vide after you complete the game, you have no idea what&#39;s waiting you."
MegMage,Reginald d&#39;Aubry&#39;s surname in polish sounds like &#39;dobry&#39; which translates into &#39;good&#39;
MegMage,"Good thing Geralt out-tongued the guy, otherwise he would&#39;ve given it to him raw."
MegMage,"The story at !:42:00 was inspiring of miracle of Christ at Cana in Galilee, when He turned water into wine :) And the prophet Lebioda is inspired by Jesus."
MegMage,"&gt; Waits outside of the home, within earshot of two lovers having loving.<br>I... see."
MegMage,Toxicity build and critical strike is op.. The more toxicity the more critical
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIoB9uBAoIU&amp;t=1h31m45s"">1:31:45</a> It&#39;s because sperm can&#39;t survive in body heat so it has to be somewhere cooler. That&#39;s why when it&#39;s hot the sack is long and baggy and in cold it&#39;s all shriveled up and close to the body"
MegMage,Oddly enough i onky use three types of amore throught the entire game play and once i get the  manticore amore that&#39;s the last armor i use
MegMage,"I get the feeling you will be encountering a lot of new words from old school english. Diddle has two meanings. A player of musical instruments is called a diddler. Diddle was also a lewd term used for various forms of fornication including fornication with beasts. <br><br>I did warn you about needing plenty of coin many times as blood and wine requires a lots of it whether it be for the house or for other things. Fortunately you will find plenty of ways to acquire more coin as blood and wine is literally drowning in coin. <br><br>I should make note to you that some quests are prerequisite for acquiring certain added bonuses. The five virtues quest may not require direct action on your part but how you do quests later on can benefit that quest with an interesting finale offering a major major major upgrade at the end especially if you had played the witcher 1. The mutagen quest is also a must as it will unlock a way to further advance your character even further in ways you have yet to achieve thus far. I shall say no more except to say its worth it. <br><br>It is best to not do the main quest too much as it advances quickly plus it will shut off your ability to access various other quests later on. My advice would be to go explore as there is many quest hubs you can unlock. Be sure to pay close attention to some of the quests especially as many have multiple endings depending on decisions you make. Be sure to also keep a close ear out for those who call out for assistance as many quests can randomly popup at any given time even in the least likely of places. These quests may not seem like much but they pay very well plus some can unlock access to merchants eager to trade. <br><br>One last word of note, you really should work on that alchemy. Some of the enemies from the witcher 1 are in witcher 3 and they are none too friendly. Archispores and giant centipedes will likely be your worst threats. This is where use of yrden and alchemy comes in handy. If ever there was a need to have the superior version of golden oriel then now is that time. You can thank me later."
MegMage,"i&#39;ve seen more gloomy weather in this video than in my whole 300 hours of playing, something is wrong with your Toussaint xD"
MegMage,on pc there are mods for better internal lighting for toussaint. :)
MegMage,I hope at the end of everything you&#39;ll replay the entire game with Polish voiceover! Have a nice day!

MegMage,<b>AH</b>
MegMage,Can a famous person like my comment?
MegMage,"Ashley will always be one of my favourite characters in Mass Effect. Her true feelings, her deeper emotional struggles, her past family issues, her arc throughout the 3 games, it all comes together so well to put together one of the more nuanced characters in the trilogy. Same kind of thing with Miranda."
MegMage,"If you get into a relationship with Tali in ME2 after getting with Ashley in ME1, Ashley will bring it up and say She&#39;s happy for them and that Tali is like a sister to her, which I feel shows how far she&#39;s come from her racism in ME1."
MegMage,"If you don&#39;t romance Ash, she and James start getting REAL cozy during the party.<br><br>Aww, they didn&#39;t have her guard distractions. They&#39;re pretty hilarious."
MegMage,"I know people call Ashley racist because she doesn&#39;t particularly care for the council races but her reasons were that at the end of the day they will only look out for themselves and she was right. The Council looked down on humans and would never have made Shepard a Spectre in the first place if Saren didn&#39;t become a huge problem for the galaxy. Also, even if you saved the Council they still dismiss everything Shepard said about the Reapers and called him a traitor for being with Cerberus to protect  human colonies that they ignored. Despite all the humans that died saving them in the first game. Even in Mass Effect 3 when the Reapers show up they only look after their own planets until they have no choice but to join together when things got worse and thousands of people died. The Asari Councilor refused to help until near the end of the game when her planet became a target but by then it was too late."
MegMage,"Ashley is truly a well written character, because of her arc, that is one of the most interesting in the trilogy.<br>She is misunderstood and gives many reasons to dislike her at the beginning, but if you choose her route, you learn so much about her and her past and things look completely different. That&#39;s why I really like this character."
MegMage,"I saved her on my first play through because to me, it made no sense for you to save somebody’s life when you first meet them just to turn around and let them die later. And because you take her in, on that first planet you find her on I started to feel responsible for her."
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql-FabjYZfo&amp;t=1h10m11s"">1:10:11</a> When I first played ME3, I had no romance arcs started at all and ended the party waking up alone. <br>Joker came up and said what he wanted at the docking bay and that &quot;The best&quot; dialogue felt the most wholesome."
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql-FabjYZfo&amp;t=58m38s"">58:38</a> true, but I’ve always found that renegade can be shortsighted, or too eager to get their hands dirty. <br>For the Council choice, I always felt that leaving them to die and saving the human ships for Sovereign was a short-sighted choice, alongside the morally wrong choice."
MegMage,"Mentioning the voice actor chemistry makes me chuckle a little, as Femshep&#39;s VA recorded all her lines first, for the rest of the cast to act off of."
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql-FabjYZfo&amp;t=25m05s"">25:05</a><br>Meg: “I’m sooooo sorry”<br>Ad: creepy turns and looks at her 😂"
MegMage,"I like that all the crew members you have in this can change, like learning about Ashleys family I like and she changing her views on aliens like that other captain on our ship. Its weird tho how the romance works in this game, Liara comes on waay to strong I find its harder to get ashley or Tali"
MegMage,"Edit: LMAO OKAY i just hit the &#39;at least she looks like a woman bit&#39; ahahahaha I take it all back.<br><br>I&#39;ve always felt &#39;racism&#39; is too strong a word to describe Ash&#39;s feelings. Like I genuinely believe that she would say the same thing (re:security stuff) about non-alliance human personnel. And I think her biases becoming more understandable when she starts opening up about her family history, and the fact that there is probably still the culture shock of suddenly realising we arent alone in the galaxy... and not nearly as special and important as we think we are. That&#39;s one of the themes I enjoy about ME, especially now I&#39;m older enough to appreciate it.<br><br>Maybe I just get her comments on &#39;needing to look out for ourselves&#39; a bit more because of my personal history. I grew up pretty conservatively Christian, and with that came an awful lot of &#39;the world isn&#39;t your ally, you have to rely on the church&#39;, so I&#39;m used to experiencing thinking that way. Likewise, since leaving that noise behind and coming out as trans, I also gravitate towards &#39;my people&#39; more... if only because I&#39;ve seen too many cis allies turn tail and run as soon as they get some pushback. Like, it&#39;s hard to trust people who don&#39;t share your experiences, and has to be learned. Which she does, and that&#39;s a good thing. Sure, they aren&#39;t alliance, and they certainly aren&#39;t human, but the theme of ME is overcoming those kinds of divisions and recognising that working together is better for us all.<br><br>Either way, Ash&#39;s growth is nice to see. You know that by the end of even the first game, she&#39;d be willing to take a bullet for any of the aliens aboard. She&#39;ll even argue you need to save the council over human lives in the last mission (admittedly only if you bring Wrex along, but that&#39;s more because bioware never seemed to decide if they want renegade to mean &#39;focused on the mission at any cost&#39;, &#39;sarcastic jerk&#39;, or &#39;genocidal racist&#39; lol), and I think it&#39;s a cute journey. You&#39;re also absolutely right: male shep really seems made for Ash lol<br><br>Sorry for the ramble aha"
MegMage,"To me, the best Broshep romances are Tali and Jack, flip a coin on which I prefer on a given day. None of them are *bad*. Well, Cortez&#39;s seems... I think Steve needed more time to truly get over Robert, but it is still well done for what it is. Kaiden is a better fit for Broshep. Plus the idea of Cortez losing Shepard after barely getting over his first husband is more than I can bear. Miranda&#39;s is very much a two ships passing in the night kind of romance. It&#39;s touching, but tragic, even more tragic than they all are by default. But Ashley&#39;s was a surprise. I liked it better than Broshep with Liara. Ashley&#39;s character growth is up there with Jack&#39;s and Liara&#39;s, perhaps even greater.<br><br>For all of them, though, it&#39;s the acting that sells it. Kimberly Brooks does an amazing job giving Ashley depth. Courtenay Taylor as Jack... that scene with Jack in the Citadel DLC where she tattoos Shepard kicks up a lot of dust."
MegMage,"Yeah. Kaidan basically has the same lines, but it&#39;s way out of character for him, whereas it fits Ashley&#39;s established character."
MegMage,"I’m not gonna harp about the Virmire choice, but I did think you didn’t really give Ash a chance the first time around to explain herself."
MegMage,I feel like both Ashley and Kayden got the short end of the stick. They are pretty much there so one of them can die off to show that the game has sticks and then in the second game they’re put off to the sidelines so we don’t get to experience or grow with them and then in the third game they get put out of commission for a good portion of it and they’re in the hospital. Compare them to say Liara who got the lion’s share of character interaction with Shepard through the three games and you can tell the survivor was kind of an afterthought.
MegMage,"I just wish ashley, at the end, said “O’ captain my captain” instead of i love you too"
MegMage,"As I said on stream I absolutely love Ashley’s romance personally. It’s a Top 5 for me. The video doesn’t show all of her arc and some of the parts of her turning into less of a xenophobe aren’t in here since Shep is playing a renegade, I personally think she’s better to save then Kaiden even if you don’t romance her or play as femshep, no disrespect to Kaiden but Ashley at least changes for better or worse throughout the games while Kaiden just seems the same all throughout imo"
MegMage,"Funny how you can hear all about Ashley&#39;s backstory as Femshep, if you stop and listen to her."
MegMage,Even I always save Ashley even if my Shepard can&#39;t romance her. They have great friendship and she cares for femshep. Also it&#39;s funny to see James and Ashley hook up in the citadel dlc.
MegMage,"I actually thought Ash was a solid character. Even her romance was really well done. But I&#39;m a hardcore Tali fan. She stuck with you thru every crappy moment and struggle. <br><br>And I agree. I found Kaiden really shallow compared to the rest. Which in today&#39;s gaming world means he would have probably been a standout...lol. KOTOR, Jade Empire, DA, and Mass Effect were just built different."
MegMage,Renegade Shep is immensely fun to play. I highly recommend
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql-FabjYZfo&amp;t=8m12s"">8:12</a> I mean, yes, but she has a point. That’s pretty much what happened at the beginning of ME3."
MegMage,ASHLEY WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING!
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql-FabjYZfo&amp;t=44m05s"">44:05</a> I actually went berserk when I saw that happen. I was hitting the trigger as fast as I could."
MegMage,"Nice.. and I agree completely. This is just like Cassandra romance. 👍👍<br><br>About the ending of Mass Effect,<br>Control is Blue because you save the Geth and EDI and the mass relays don&#39;t get destroyed. Also the Reapers will be guardian of the Milky Way protecting them.<br><br>Destroy is Red and a renegade option because Geth die and EDI also dies. Because Mass Relays are destroyed, no more quick travel between places so things become harder."
MegMage,I will personally say Ashley is a really good character she is really misunderstood and blown off as a &quot;Racist&quot; character. In reality No she is not a Racist character people say that because she a dislike to any Non human squadmates in ME1. But lets not forget that In ME1 and ME2 the counsel treats humans as a lower class. Let&#39;s not forget the Salarians literally unleased a sterilization bio weapon onto the Krogan there are more characters who are more racist than Ashley. Ashley is not a bad character saying is like saying that Jacob is a better character than Ashley. No She is not and if you take the time to talk to her and give her a chance she is a really good romance option. Her &quot;Hate for nonhuman characters&quot; actually grows in ME3. She says that she considers Tali as her little sister. Ashley&#39;s growth as a character is the best part about her. Yes She kills Wrex on virmire but look at this. What if Wrex suddenly decided to kill shepard right there. No one would be able to step up as the commanding role. Trust me when i say this Ashley is not a racist character and even if she was considered one her growth from ME1 all the way to ME3 where she accepts and openly talks to nonhuman teammates is well written growth and development for her AND LETS NOT FORGET that even tho the counsel was xenophobic and talked down upon the human race Ashley stood in defense of the counsel during the citidel coup.
MegMage,"The way the Virmire Survivor story/dialog in ME2 and 3 were written seems to be with Ash in mind (given 80% of players played as BroShep according to BioWare).  Kaidan&#39;s story arc in 3 makes no sense with his character in 1.  <br>Of the 3 male Shepard romantic partners you can elope with in 2, Ashley is OK with Tali, pissed with Jack and especially Miranda.<br>Hope you do the other Andromeda romances and maybe play something from BioWare&#39;s earlier repertoire, like KotOR or Fable."
MegMage,&quot;I want EDI to choke me&quot; Did you get possessed by Specialist Traynor just then?
MegMage,"Yes! React to &quot;Audemus&#39;s Happy Ending Mod&quot; it&#39;s so good! Also, the &quot;Miranda Mod&quot; is another great ME3 mod."
MegMage,"I always lets Ashley shoot Udina, lol."
MegMage,"I&#39;m sorry, but even though it&#39;s an emotional scene, I can&#39;t help but laugh to myself when I see the hospital scene. Mass Effect Gamer Poop has ruined it for me. I can&#39;t watch it without hear Shep saying,  &quot;We&#39;ll bang, okay? I&#39;ll fuck you soon.&quot; LOL"
MegMage,I really want an Unreal Engine 5 remake of ME 1 - 3
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql-FabjYZfo&amp;t=22m00s"">22:00</a> and That’s why I declined Liara in person before it got to this point."
MegMage,&quot;Anyway...what&#39;s your opinion on the last mission?&quot;<br>Ad: MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!! <br><br>What comedic timing that was
MegMage,"MegMage if you replay, you should totally download the happy ending mod. If you enter the mission with a galactic readiness of 7800 or above you get a totally original ending. Infinitely improves the ending and gets rid of the starchild."
MegMage,Ashley is alittle raciat but she isnt a bad person  i think their a fine line its like rwby weiss starts abit raciat but its apart their arc ashley  like pressly grow to trust aliens ashley is paranoid rather than hatful to aliens  its more ignorance and paranoia about somthing that isnt human its harder to empathise inherently  with somthing alien to you  but she isnt evil
MegMage,"I saved Ashley my first playthrough but regretted it so much I didn&#39;t invite her onto the Normandy in ME3. Now everytime I invite Kaidan/Ashley back onboard the Normandy I sort of regret it, Kaidan has nothing to offer and Ashley just quotes generic poetry. It&#39;s personal of course but I always rather talk to the other companions."
MegMage,Before the video: haha Ashley racist<br><br>After the video: here is why Ashley is the canon romance
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql-FabjYZfo&amp;t=25m41s"">25:41</a> I watch so much YouTube that I went ahead and got YouTube Premium. If you want to have no ads and still support the creators, that&#39;s the way to go."
MegMage,"Ashley is not racist, she is not xenophobic, she is not bigoted. She is a woman who realizes that, if push comes to shove, the council races are gonna look after their own interests before looking out for the humans. People say she is xenophobic (Meg) because she has these comments and thoughts; she literally has very little contact with aliens beyond her training, but also because her family fought in the first contact war, and was subsequently blacklisted because of their action during the war. Everything she has at the point of meeting Shepard and beyond, she worked her ass off and fought tooth and nail for it. <br>She doesnt trust the aliens, because 30ish years ago at that point, they went through a relay, and immediately got into a war with a species that picked a fight with them, and now all of a sudden, they are all buddy buddy with humans. Liked I said, she knows that they will leave humans hung out to dry if trouble comes up, as is evident in ME3, as you saw."
MegMage,Please play infamous the originals if possible they are soo good
MegMage,"@MegMage, Ashley and Shepard have one of the greatest romances in the franchise. From the time Shepard saves Ashley on eden prime, he sees a brave, courageous, confident woman. Shepard can talk to her on the Normandy, and share his feelings with her, and help her grow as a character. <br>Shepard can visit her in the hospital while she&#39;s in bed and when she&#39;s fully recovered, to show her how much he loves her. He can also buy her that Alfred Tennyson book, and Congratulate her on her spectre status. Ashley trusting Shepard that he&#39;s still that guy she always loved, even during the citadel coup attempt, says a lot. Upon her return to the Normandy crew, Shepard gives Ashley emotional support, after her youngest sister Sarah lost her husband. <br>Shepard can spend quality time with Ashley on the Normandy, the citadel, at the silversun stripe bar, at the citadel dlc party and in the captain&#39;s cabin. Shepard and Ashley have been through a lot together, and still manage to keep their relationship strong. They say they love each other, before Shepard&#39;s noble sacrifice at the crucible. Ashley puts Shepard&#39;s name plate on the memorial wall in memory of a man that loved her and gave his all to protect her."
MegMage,Red destroy is renegade  <br><br>Destroy means all synthetics that includes edi and the geth
MegMage,"I still find it so bullshit that if you save Kaiden instead, in Mass Effect 3 you literally have the option to romance Kaiden as a gay option for MaleShep but if you save Ash with FemShep, there&#39;s no romance option but while although they do get a couple of moments together you can&#39;t romance her as FemShep. Thats so unfair"
MegMage,Yea the shanxie stuff really defines ash <br><br>People miss abit conte t on the war the turians bombed civilian sectors from orbit and blockaded the colony take all the starvation and probelms in a place like cuba feom the sanctions they have double it and add   bombing raids worse than ww2 blitz and you have shanxie her grandfather saved civilian lives by surendering but destroyed his carrer her families only interaction with aliens was turians killing civilians and comitting war crimes
MegMage,I love the way Americans try and force their oblique millennial political concepts onto intergalactic political struggles with no sense of irony or self-awareness.
MegMage,"Everything Ashley said ended up being correct, lol."
MegMage,Ash is my space wife.
MegMage,Dr.Chocolates makes so much more sense now. Hmm...
MegMage,Did she really punch gherman
MegMage,One of the best game
MegMage,lol don&#39;t worry wait until the end then remember this moment

MegMage,Play far cry six
MegMage,"IT&#39;S HERE! The long awaited Citadel DLC! I started it this episode, and go to Thessia in the next. Don&#39;t worry, I brought Javik! Enjoy &lt;3"
MegMage,"This whole DLC is basically fanservice. Though I&#39;d say it hits especially hard for folks that played it later. Anyhow, while some might find it cheesy and think fanservice is &quot;stupid pandering&quot;, I disagree because i find this DLC basically a love letter to the series as a whole, it pays attention to what we actually cared about the most."
MegMage,Best DLC Ever. It does everything you need. A fun story and a lot of fan service.
MegMage,"Noticed you didn&#39;t check the trash next to the elevator before going down. Your hamster is in there as your clone plans to get rid of him and Shepard says something like, &quot;She messed with my hamster, guys. Now it&#39;s personal.&quot; It was so funny when I discovered that and really pumped me up for the boss fight. 😂"
MegMage,"I think you haven&#39;t gotten any Mass Effect fans saying, &quot;You&#39;re just playing this now?&quot; because we all wish we could have a memory wipe and experience it again for the first time. Folks like you who are just now discovering it are the next best thing."
MegMage,"Kaidan&#39;s comment that he &quot;never gets picked&quot; was actually because you picked him the least of all your squadmates. In that little exchange, the first person to speak is always the person you take most among the people not going and the second is always the person among them who&#39;s been picked least."
MegMage,The Citadel DLC aka The fellowship of Shepard &amp; the toothbrush of faith.<br>Love this DLC &amp; the little things you can do with your crewmates after the missions.
MegMage,"I didn&#39;t play this in my initial playthrough in 2012, so it was a real treat getting to play this when I bought the Legendary Edition. Great send off for the characters."
MegMage,"I know that girl next ot the roulette table is annoying, but if you go back to her again you get this<br><br>Aishwarya :Back for more?<br><br>Shepard: What can I say? I&#39;m a masochist.<br><br>Aishwarya: Ohhhh, that&#39;s cool! I&#39;m a Scorpio!"
MegMage,"My favorite DLC. Fanservice? yes, but with heart. Also, it&#39;s like Mass Effect turned into an action-comedy and I love that."
MegMage,The fact that the throwaway toothbrush line from the beginning of the game got called back in this DLC had me on the floor.
MegMage,It&#39;s always a good time when you watch someone new experience the Citadel DLC Blind. B)
MegMage,Brooks always gives me this uncanny valley vibes whenever I see her. I like it when my girl Liara sassed her out in this dlc. <br><br>It was really entertaining to see you have fun playing this dlc. Looking forward to the party 😁
MegMage,"Is it just me or did anyone else love when Anderson described in the interview all of his experiences in the Mass Effect games and life before the events of Shepard?<br><br>Note how the N7 program, as he describes it, is exactly what Shepard went through as well before becoming a Spectre. Total badasses"
MegMage,My favorite part of the whole trilogy! 😍
MegMage,"I just noticed that in the end scene, Joker&#39;s gait was much improved from what we&#39;ve seen in ME2"
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqdTbfhndlQ&amp;t=55m13s"">55:13</a> I love how despite her homeworld being a top priority, the other thing that fires up Tali the most is losing her shot at eating sushi. XD"
MegMage,"If I’m remembering right, you didn’t end up dancing with Liara before the point of no return in ME1. The dance the two of them do in the casino is the same as back then. It’s a nice call back."
MegMage,"Wrex is absolute gold to bring with you to the casino (Korgan in a tux!), but walking arm in arm with your date is also a good choice."
MegMage,Man the final scene after the party where everyone is heading out.  It always chokes me up because it felt more like a farewell to the series and all it&#39;s characters than the actual end to the game.
MegMage,General rule of thumb for who to bring (not always applicable but it is most of the time) &quot;who do I bring alongside my love interest&quot;. There&#39;s a lot of unique dialogue for LI&#39;s in the game
MegMage,You should totally watch the compilation of everyone shooting Brooks. It&#39;s amazing.
MegMage,Your bloodlust for beheadings was hilarious 😆
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqdTbfhndlQ&amp;t=2h06m36s"">2:06:36</a> I love how Shepard just got finished asking if her crew could finally hit something instead of being comedians.<br><br>They all proceed to miss this one person until Meg shoots them."
MegMage,Good job i love it so far your videos are amazing 🙂 keep it up 🙂 and have a great day 😊
MegMage,Best DLC ever. Of all time. Change my mind.
MegMage,"Funny thing, I heard it so many times in-game and in some tributes I&#39;ve been watching since my first playthrough that I know Anderson&#39;s recording about Shepard by heart."
MegMage,"Fun fact: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqdTbfhndlQ&amp;t=1m41s"">1:41</a> Anderson and his ex-wife divorced in the year Saren made sure Anderson fail in becoming a Spectre candidate in the Mass Effect Revelation novel. It affected him so badly that he went to Chora&#39;s Den to get drunk, and afterwards in the novel, a part of him desperately wanted to have a romantic relationship with Kahlee even though they both knew it wouldn&#39;t work out the way they hoped, with Kahlee working on classified projects and Anderson out patrolling space and all."
MegMage,&quot;No one steals my ship... not even me.&quot;<br><br>*says the one who already had to steal their own ship in the first game.
MegMage,"If only you have chosen Javik, at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqdTbfhndlQ&amp;t=2h26m51s"">2:26:51</a> he would say &quot;finally&quot;. Because he likes to throw things out of the airlock."
MegMage,"The Citadel DLC doesn&#39;t unlock until after the Citadel/Cerberus mission, so you don&#39;t even have an opportunity to bring Thane along."
MegMage,"Wrex and Grunt were the best in this DLC, I love Krogans"
MegMage,I always purposely extend the fight scenes in the DLC because the banter is just too fucking hilarious<br><br>Edit: YOU MISSED THE SPACE HAMSTER DIALOGUE 😭
MegMage,Were people giving MegMage crap because she decided to kill Brooks? Cause Brooks totally deserved that shot in the back. She just uses people and screws them over. She probably used a lot of people including Shepard&#39;s clone. You can see it in her eyes throughout the mission. Genius part on the writers and actors.
MegMage,"Cat 6, is a short lived Ethernet cabling standard, quickly supplanted by 6A. Either way, Cat 5e being 1gps is sufficient for most. I use 6A to connect cable modem to my router and my router to my smart hub. But every thing else in my home is Cat 5e or higher."
MegMage,Advice: don&#39;t start the party until you help Miranda with her sister
MegMage,"I was really hoping you&#39;d take EDI with you and I felt if someone suggested that you do so might have been a bit of a spoiler, so glad you did and did so without it being suggested or you being told to, love your reaction to that... moment, lol"
MegMage,Meg: I get to fight with Wrex!<br><br>Also Meg: &lt;shoots at Wrex first&gt;
MegMage,I took wrex with me on every citadel mission.. Worth it
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqdTbfhndlQ&amp;t=02h50m48s"">02:50:48</a> this part is bit different if you have talked with Conrad Verner. She instead says &quot;Are you kidding me? Conrad Verner is better being me than you!&quot;"
MegMage,I really enjoyed watching this play thru!
Youtuber,Comments
alliebeemac,the scene where shulk finds out whos in silver face...it gets my heart beating every time. it hits me hard each time
alliebeemac,I found your chanel randomly and now I love it. You&#39;re just amazing :)
alliebeemac,"I&#39;ve played the original and it is one of my favs, I love being able to see people play it for the first time and see how they react and I have to say yours are some of the best. As I am playing through Defintive Edition after I play I find myself checking some vids to see how others reacted to the parts I just played.<br><br>The developers put some mich work into this with lovely details hidden all over. Keep an eye on Melia going forward and her body language whenever Fiora is mentioned"
alliebeemac,"Loved this episode, and I hope you know you&#39;re allowed to cry, emotions are healthy!"
alliebeemac,"Also I&#39;m not quite sure what to tell people who think Shulk sounds too old for an 18 year old? Like, my voice broke when I was around 15 and I can sure tell you it was deeper than his is now.<br>This isn&#39;t to have a go, but I feel like a lot of Americans have these set expectations for British voices, typically believing all of us to have what&#39;s typically known as &quot;BBC English&quot; (stereotypical posh British accents). When I hear all of these characters speak it sounds natural to me. I&#39;m hearing accents from different regions of the UK and each one having their own way of wording things like Reyn&#39;s tendency to make shortcut&#39;s in his sentences with &quot;wossat&#39;s&quot; and such.<br><br>I will say something about English dubbing in general for voice acting: No matter what, there&#39;s always going to be something inferior about a dub that isn&#39;t the intended language. The performance in Xenoblade is fantastic but unfortunately as you can see, the lip sync is clearly meant for Japanese audio meaning there&#39;ll always be something &quot;off&quot; about it.<br>An interesting thing to also consider is that modern Japanese acting in general actually originates from old fashioned Kabuki theatre. Stage plays where the men would exaggerate their movements, including their body language, facial expressions and even their voices would pick out particular words to emphasise an action. you can argue that western theatre does that too, but take a look at a traditional performance on Youtube and you might understand where I&#39;m coming from. Japanese TV shows, anime and even their video games are all very reflective of this, showing signs of these acting habits have not dwindled in the slightest over all these years.<br>To put simply, there are certain things that will NEVER look right when dubbed over in English because WESTERN acting had never fostered such exaggeration for it to feel right in its performances, American, British or otherwise.<br><br>Sometimes you either just have to give your best performance even at the risk of not matching the Japanese actions or the dev can do something incredibly costly and completely reanimate the scene in order to match English emphasis and performance.<br>There IS actually some games to which their engines allow the lip syncing to automatically match whatever&#39;s being spoken no matter the language even DURING a cinematic cut-scene. The issue however would lie with the ACTIONS not lining up with what&#39;s being said, not the mouth movements.<br><br>I went on a tangent, sorry. This wasn&#39;t meant to target anyone in particular but I just felt like I had to explain that and why English dubs no matter the accent deserves a little more credit."
alliebeemac,Love how everyone EXCEPT the one who should be naked is naked
alliebeemac,i&#39;m also playing right now the high entia arc. Your comments and stream is enjoyable. Subscribed. :)
alliebeemac,&quot;How do ya like that?!&quot;<br><br><b>0 DAMAGE</b>
alliebeemac,"Really random point in the stream but as a British person myself, I&#39;ve always pronounced geyser as &quot;guyz-er&quot;. I have heard people say &quot;geezer&quot; multiple times but it never sounded right to me."
alliebeemac,"Very late, but some advice on the whole &quot;You know who.&quot;<br>We call them &quot;7&quot; to prevent spoilers"

alliebeemac,It’s just a bunch of weebs that say the English voice acting is bad.
alliebeemac,"Why were you talking about sexualizing children? You know all if these characters are 18 and over, right?"
alliebeemac,allie you are so cute when being scared :D
alliebeemac,"You had hard time with that creature with eyeballs, you just needed to use sniper rifle to shot eyeball after that its imobilize for 5 sec and in that time shot front 2 heads after that it will go to second stage and this time eyeball will show in the middle of body in his mouths, use freeze bolt to stun him and shot eyeball again, followed by another shot in body and he is down"
alliebeemac,I know this is old but that Irving troll should&#39;ve been banned asap. Any other follower could&#39;ve double checked whatever crap he was messaging on the chat to avoid unecessary stress.
alliebeemac,God those Joel and Ellie flashbacks twisted my heart strings 💔
alliebeemac,"That end of that last flashback is a dead ringer for the Ellie+Riley incident (if, for example, Riley would have shot Ellie), and I think Ellie was immediately thrown back to her survival and the accompanying guilt of being immune. It&#39;s no surprise that she brought up the hospital right there due to that guilt again. She never came to terms with the hospital incident (even if she didn&#39;t know for sure what happened there)."
alliebeemac,"~<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YMhrTg4J9s&amp;t=2h32m00s"">2:32:00</a> ... During the truck scene, on my 1st playthrough, my heart was racing because that shit was INTENSE!!!  And then when the infected showed up?!?  Damn!!!"
alliebeemac,"I realize this comment is being left 6 months or so after she played, but this is for anyone reading this down the line who decides they want to play Part 2: <b>You do not have to kill the dogs.</b>  You do have to kill one because it is a quick time event the game forces on you, but all other dogs, if you use bricks and bottles, you can throw them to distract the dogs.  Yes it makes the game a tad harder, but it is an option.  <b>Also using your pistol with a silencer or bow and arrow and getting a headshot on the dog&#39;s handler will kill him but the dog will not alert other WLF</b>  If another WLF sees the kill, they&#39;ll alert the others, but if you do it in stealth, ya you can avoid killing almost all the doggos."
alliebeemac,Allie [Hears WLF talking} Can&#39;t wait to kill all you!<br>(Sees a dog)<br>Allie: [Screams] No!  Nooooo!  NNOOOOOOOO!<br>😂😂😂
alliebeemac,Uses molotovs on 2 WLF... <br>[Talking to tv about the dog] Allie: Can we be friends?  (One second later)<br>Shoots the dog in the head 🤣🤣
alliebeemac,Papa Joel = Fire Bloater Killer
alliebeemac,I hinestly gotta ask if Allie is still enjoying the game. After Joel&#39;s death this game is just painful to play and gameplay wise it gets so boring at times. And the flashbacks dont help either. They look like they are rubbing in your face that Joel died
alliebeemac,Even worse is on Twitter I saw comparison images where in the trailer they put an older Joel in the trailers to make you think he was gonna be going with you. That’s some real crappy stuff to do. It’s not like Avengers leaving Fat Thor out of Marketing
alliebeemac,If people get this mad about false advertising wait until they hear about capitalism
alliebeemac,"The Jesse thing is so fucking obvious I can&#39;t believe it. They edited the character skins in the trailers to muck up the timeline too. Know why? <br><br>BECAUSE JOEL FUCKING DIES IN THE GAME AND THEY DIDN&#39;T WANT TO SPOIL IT! LIKE WTF!? <br><br>How is this so incomprehensible to some people, imagine the alternative, and people just notice &quot;Hey, Joel isn&#39;t in any of the trailers! He must be dead!&quot;<br>Honest marketing would have fucking RUINED this game and I can prove it:<br>THE GAME GOT LEAKED AND IT FUCKING RUINED THE RELEASE<br><br>No excuse to be mad about this, no one. Trailers lie all the time and for good reason and if you can&#39;t handle it, you need to actually become an adult."
alliebeemac,The video is exactly 2 hours 😂
alliebeemac,"still not over that scene where Jesse appeared instead of Joel just like trailer provided us, pissed me off (no hate Jesse, you&#39;re a beast). It&#39;s very scummy to lie about someone&#39;s appearance in the trailer when that exact character, we love and played with the most, dies worst way possible, smh. Joel would&#39;ve fit that spot way better, especially with the quote he had in the trailer."
alliebeemac,"I haven&#39;t played the game I will admit, but almost  everything I have seen makes it seem like such a let down. To go from a story of a jaded man finding a second chance with a new daughter like figure; to a half assed revenge plot really doesn&#39;t sit well with me."
alliebeemac,everyone getting masd like &quot;omg no joel false advertising&quot;<br>imagine believing that advertisements should spoil what happens? ND have done this before intentionally so this was most certaintly intentionally to throw you off.<br><br>also the ad is a nod to Ellie&#39;s grief of his loss
alliebeemac,"I say this as someone who loves your playthroughs. <br> <br>My god, the babyrage. If they just didn&#39;t show Joel in any trailers it would be incredibly obvious that he dies. The whole point of changing scenes and heavily implying that Dina dies is so you know what the game is about without having major moments spoiled for you. Y&#39;know, the entire point of trailers. You not being emotionally equipped to handle the loss of a character isn&#39;t the game&#39;s fault, and it certainly isn&#39;t the game&#39;s fault that you threw logic out the window then built hopes and expectations based off of a clip in the trailer despite seeing the character die hours previously.<br> <br>Watching you spout the same illogical arguments as people saying &quot;lol abby trans&quot; and even calling something that happened in the trailer &quot;bad writing&quot; comes off as someone who can&#39;t handle their emotions and expectations and is instead placing blame on others. Meanwhile your chat is calling an Asian character &quot;ling ling&quot; and that is apparently acceptable because of your emotional immaturity.<br> <br>I honestly expected this to be one of my favorite playthroughs where a streamer expresses their emotions without falling into the &quot;I can&#39;t accept this&quot;&gt;&quot;Therefore this is unfair&quot;&gt;&quot;Therefore I have been wronged&quot;&gt;&quot;Therefore the game is wrong&quot; spiral, but I suppose that was a failure of my own expectations."
alliebeemac,"So here are all the deaths, from my understanding:<br><b>Molly’s death:</b> Consumed poisonous holly berries and poisonous toothpaste, the combination of which caused her to hallucinate before she died from those poisons<br><b>Odin’s death:</b> Drowned during a storm at sea and sunk along with the house before his body was retrieved from the wreckage<br><b>Calvin’s death:</b> Flew off of a swing and fell to his death<br><b>Barbara’s death:</b> Her’s was very ambiguous, she was likely killed by “The Hookman” because her ear was the only thing left behind. I think he probably ate her, like the radio said he had done before to his family. That or she died some other way and Edie just exaggerated elements of her death to make it more &quot;memorable&quot;<br><b>Walter’s death:</b> Hit by a train after breaking out of his hideaway<br><b>Sam’s death:</b> Bucked off of a cliff by a deer, falling to his death while Dawn watched<br><b>Gregory’s death:</b> Drowned in a tub after his mother left him alone to answer a phone call from her then husband, Sam<br><b>Gus’s death:</b> Hit and killed by flying debris from a bad storm<br><b>Milton’s death:</b> Technically never confirmed in-game, he was just “presumed dead” after he went missing<br><b>Lewis’s death:</b> Decapitating himself after his imagination took over his perception of reality<br><b>Edie’s death:</b> Mixing alcohol with her medication<br><b>Dawn’s death:</b> Some unknown illness (apparently it was possibly genetic, according to some theories)<br><b>Edith’s death:</b> Childbirth (her final story involved the birth of her son and nothing else, so it’s universally accepted that that’s what killed her)<br><br>I honestly love that, in order to be able to understand some of the more obscure-seeming deaths, you have to pay close attention to the details. I personally do this a lot anyway, especially in games, so I really appreciated how much it was encouraged (which most other games don’t bother to do, so it really made this game seem high-quality to me). Everything presented to the player is important to the story. It’s a beautifully done masterpiece."
alliebeemac,Everytime i watch this i just burst In tears totally one of my favourite games
alliebeemac,Lewis’s story could be a whole game
alliebeemac,"Late comment, but man I love this game. The themes of the inevitability of death and appreciating life while you have it are <b>so</b> good.<br>I think when it comes down to it, there was no curse. Or, rather, the &quot;curse&quot; is just an exaggeration of the fact that death is inevitable and impossible to escape or hide from. While the Finch family was in many ways unlucky, their belief in the curse seemed to lead to them being either so blasé they were careless with situations that led to their deaths (or someone else&#39;s deaths; Calvin is the biggest example of this, but also Gus and Sam) or interpreting tragic accidents as further proof of a curse (like with Gregory), and the death all around them drove some of them into mental states that were harmful to them but totally understandable (particularly Walter and Lewis). Sam was careless with his life, &quot;going out of his way to meet [death],&quot; for years before it actually got him killed, Edie lived to be in her 90s, and while some things seem to imply even marrying into the family &quot;spreads the curse to them&quot; (like with Ingeborg, Sven, and Sanjay) there&#39;s no implication at all that Kay or Sam&#39;s unnamed second wife died.<br>You&#39;ve probably already seen &quot;The Villain of Edith Finch&quot; by now, but I&#39;m going to deviate from it slightly by saying that I don&#39;t think Edie was the villain. She was effed up, but she was dealing badly with horrible ideas that she too had grown up with and a ton of death surrounding her; her own father, Odin, would have introduced all that stuff about the Finch family curse to her, and since their family curse was so famous already, it&#39;s likely his own parents introduced it to him. The game is, imo, about the messy ways people deal with loss and grief and the fear of death. Everyone tried to handle things differently and didn&#39;t see how they were contributing, and you just can&#39;t escape death, whether you try to hide from it in a bunker or run away from it or look it in the eyes without fear. Whether you give your kids a lot of freedom or try hard to protect them, whether you tell them the truth or hide it, death and loss exist and they&#39;ll be confronted with it.<br>And, in the end, Edie was right that &quot;the thing you&#39;re afraid of isn&#39;t going to end when you leave the house.&quot; Death still exists; sometimes people get sick and die, and some people die in childbirth, and Dawn couldn&#39;t stop that. Edith&#39;s final entreaties to her child, to &quot;appreciate how strange and brief all of this is&quot; and &quot;to be amazed that any of us ever had a chance to be here at all&quot; are I think the biggest takeaway of the game: loss hurts and life is short, but we can&#39;t let that destroy us. The Finches are cursed to die, and humanity is the Finches, and we just have to deal with that as best we can and live happily anyway."
alliebeemac,"Wonderful playthrough, Allie. You talk about having concerns about setting the right tone in these types of games, but you always do so in the moments that demand it, I feel"
alliebeemac,"In the home school around 2hours and 10 minutes, Dawn was trying desperately to demystify the Finch Family in the eyes of her children. As Dawn says at the end of the game &quot;My children are dead because of your stories.&quot; Great G-Ma Edie was obsessed with death and legacy. If you ask me, I think she is the one who made up the curse when you look at things objectively.<br><br>Sure there is a viewfinder at Odin&#39;s monument in Edie&#39;s room that claims that for centuries the Finch family had been famous for their fortune (wealth) and misfortune. But all of the pictures used were pictures that could have only been taken by someone in the family. Because if the Finches were truly that famous, they would have never been alone at the graveyard to bury Ingeborg and Johann. Additionally, one of the pictures was taken DURING the trip to America when the storm whipped up. The only people who could have taken those photos were people who were on that same trip.<br><br>Odin did not fear death he studied it, a curse should not have frightened him enough to try to move the entire home to the New World. However, war is a very different subject. Europe was engrossed in WWII the year Odin fled the country with his family. When he died at Sea, Edie made a monument that depicted herself as standing tall with her husband dropped to his knees, reaching out to his father-in-law and clutching desperately at Molly, when in the photos we know that Edie was the one holding her child then thanks to the photos in the viewfinder.<br><br>As time went on, Edie&#39;s obsession with death and legacy grew. She got herself into the news as often as she could, whether it be to give an interview about her son who buried himself under her house, not leaving a forest fire area, and even telling stories that glorified and mythologized the deaths of her family members, like the details about her house she sold to the comic book company THE YEAR AFTER HER DAUGHTER DIED or a dragon killing her husband on the day of her youngest son&#39;s birthday (Walter btw).<br><br>Edie then spread this viewpoint of death to all of her kids and their kids. When you grow up with a twisted viewpoint on life and death of course you aren&#39;t going to look at life in a way that preserves yourself. You will believe that you are going to die and that there is no controlling it, so why would you ever act in any way that wasn&#39;t living life the way you wanted. You&#39;ll die when you die. It is like the most optimistic form of nihilism, and worse because of its origin, it is generational abuse.<br><br>Dawn tried desperately to keep the abuse from spreading to her children, but when Sanjay died, she was forced to go back and then her children were exposed to it through Edie herself, since Dawn would not pass it on her own.<br><br>I really feel for Dawn, she tried so fucking hard to save her kids, keep them away from that house and that legacy only to have bad luck that would force her back and the abuse would continue. When Milton disappeared and Lewis killed himself, Dawn saw it all happening all over again. So she did the only thing she could think of which was blow the whole thing up. Send the old croon to a home and steal her daughter away before the abuse could take her. But then the guilt set in and it literally started killing her from grief. She was not strong enough to fix the problem herself, so she hoped to spare Edith that fate by sending her back, learning the truth without anyone else there, and hopefully heal. But bad luck struck again, and Edith died of complications from giving birth. Now we will never know what the ultimate fate of that family line."
alliebeemac,"My read of the &#39;curse&#39; has always been that it was largely on Edie. Throughout the section with Walter you were wondering why she didn&#39;t get him out of the bunker and I think the answer is that it&#39;s not as good of a story as the Moleman Tragedy. You see that far more explicitely with the Barbara comic; she doesn&#39;t want to remember the facts but wants to remember a more interesting story. She never made any effort to stop the curse herself, and actively encouraged it as much as she could without actively murdering her family"
alliebeemac,"They had some solar panels on the roof, that probably why some of the lights were on. I don’t get how the lightbulbs weren’t fried though."
alliebeemac,"This play through would&#39;ve been so much better if you hadn&#39;t streamed it. Trying to call every future plot point and getting most of them wrong was annoying to hear, especially over the top of the narration, rather than just being immersed. Chat distractions and spoilers certainly didn&#39;t help. This game definitely rewards immersion. I&#39;m sad for you that you didn&#39;t get that experience.<br><br>Still liked (and &quot;Liked&quot;) the video and appreciated your playthrough. It just felt like you were in completely the wrong mindset and setting to receive this story. I hope you enjoyed it, and always appreciate your insight into the games you play. Your perspective is always very thoughtful and you convey your ideas well. 🤓"
alliebeemac,I would suggest you to watch &quot;The villain of Edith Finch&quot; for some cool theories.

alliebeemac,"Hope they sort it out soon for Allie,looking forward to seeing you back live."
alliebeemac,I am so glad that you are playing this game. It was my personal game of the year when it came out.
alliebeemac,"My favorite part was when a mimic disguised as a coffee cup jumped out from under a table and she walked over it without noticing or being attacked (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyOsJ_dn13M&amp;t=1h13m54s"">1:13:54</a>)"
alliebeemac,Nice keep up making the good vids and streaming streams
alliebeemac,I&#39;d say unedited is fun. Peeps can jump around if they don&#39;t wanna see certain parts. Particularly since there&#39;s a lot of important/interesting enviroment stuff when you&#39;re running around not knowing what you&#39;re doing. lol
alliebeemac,The one dad I won’t disappoint ❤️
alliebeemac,"Wow, I&#39;ve never seen anyone both over-think and under-think a question like this before. Fuck, this is just the introduction."

alliebeemac,"I&#39;d say just throw the stream up with little to no editing, there&#39;s really no need to edit out slower / boring sections since people can just skip forward in the video.<br><br>Aw the emotes 💔"

alliebeemac,Have you played Second Son on stream yet?
alliebeemac,"I say just do the raw play through, no editing needed."
alliebeemac,I&#39;m really not a fan of the constant pausing for stream interaction.
alliebeemac,I like this girl
alliebeemac,You are the best
alliebeemac,alliebeemac hello
alliebeemac,I accidentally fell asleep but I had the stream still playing in the back ground also quick note the re1 remaster was way better then the first edition just the estitic and the voice acting and the script it&#39;s a great game the fix camera angle is odd but if I rmb they do have the option to change the old tank controls to just basic controls worth checking out if you want more of the resident evil storyline
alliebeemac,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k69WeFiMwSg&amp;t=2h36m49s"">2:36:49</a> Oh yeah I understand.  Well, Leon is a rookie cop, so this is supposed to show how inexperience he is.  He doesn&#39;t know Chief Irons besides being his future boss, so he wants to impress him (Not knowing Irons is a psychopath).  Also, since he&#39;s inexperience, he wants to have someone he can trust in a situation with zombies and Bio Weapons, and not knowing who Ben is and hearing that he was locked up by his boss, he doesn&#39;t want to have a bad impression, not to mention let go a very dangerous criminal that could stab him in the back while fighting zombies and mutants.  Anyways, in future games, he gets experience and doesn&#39;t act like this.  His character development is amazing in the series, which is why he is my favorite character!  😄  Still, awesome gameplays"
alliebeemac,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k69WeFiMwSg&amp;t=2h36m49s"">2:36:49</a><br>Well to be fair to Leon, he didn’t know a giant fucking hand would come through the wall and crush the guy’s skull. Plus unlike the drowning of prisoners you mentioned that happened in Hurricane Katrina, the whistle blower is probably more safe in a cell than outside where there are a bunch of infected. So I truly don’t understand your point here at all, it sounds like your blaming Leon for nothing except making sure it’s alright to release the prisoner, which to be honest it probably isn’t. He has a high chance of being infected if we release him since we don’t really see any weapons on him. I get it’s an outbreak but they don’t have any evacuations underway so it would be pointless to release him, and even if he did escape the town he could spread the virus further. Plus if by chance the guy was already infected, would he do more harm in or outside a cell? Exactly. I also get it isn’t for the right reason, but at least he did a good action. Though it depends on whether you think the intention or action is more important. From what I’ve seen from you, it’s based off the action rather than the intention, so that should be a good thing."

It would have turned out the same."

If you put the basic one on, I&#39;ve seen sites that state that will fix it.  Sorry if this is to late."
alliebeemac,"Ok, i have noticed a few things where you are going wrong here.<br>Boozer&#39;s arm was not his fault. Even if he let Deacon dress his arm up in the first place, Boozer still would have to lose his arm, because thats a third degree burn, just a dressing of sterile bandages are not going to help him. <br>Second, the drugs you had at the start were narcotics, meaning they arent used as a medicine.<br>Third, Iron Mike was not doing business with the rippers, he just signed a peace treaty, meaning they wont attack the rippers, and the rippers wont attack them on purpose.<br>Thats different from doing business. Its like we leave them alone, they leave us alone.<br>Thats all I wanted to say, i know its late but I felt like saying this"

alliebeemac,"i have the same horse skin, I got it as a sign of support for LGBTQ awareness, promised i would only ride phobos in this skin."
alliebeemac,Dying light was a legend can&#39;t wait for dying light 2
alliebeemac,Fact:<br>When you still kept your weak weapons. Dont sell em disassemble them instead<br>Some weapons give u metal parts and nails<br>Thats how i got 879 metal parts :D<br>Keep finding airdrops with the relief on site packages<br>It gives survivor points<br>Grind a ton and then wait for night time to double the xp when selling<br>Switch the game on nightmare for x20 xp multiplier on night
alliebeemac,This game is not that long i did the full story and the side quest in 1 sit it took me 1 hour and 48 min 👍
alliebeemac,"Hi, can you help me with an online trophy? :/"
alliebeemac,Hi allie can you play rdr1
alliebeemac,Dying light was a legend can&#39;t wait for dying light 2
alliebeemac,"Hurts especially bad because if Mono would just be selfish, he could escape from the loop, but he is a fundamentally good kid, so he&#39;ll just go on being punished for his kindness forever"
alliebeemac,"Six is the Lady and Mono is the Thin Man, they both became the nightmares they were trying to escape"
alliebeemac,"Spoilers of the ending...sort of...for those who haven&#39;t watched/finished LN2<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Sad part is that Mono was never angry at Six, he just gave up, succumbed within the TV and became the Thin Man to sit in that chair...<br>Until his past self comes back and frees him again, only to die and fail to stop his past self from feeling that sort of pain."
alliebeemac,Your the first person I saw that cried at the end and I&#39;m happy I&#39;m not the only one that thought it was sad on that part
alliebeemac,I’ve watched your lives for the last of us and little nightmares 2 and I just wanna say I love your takes so much!!
alliebeemac,"If it’s like a time loop, I wonder if Six is actually the cause of it. Maybe if Six never dropped Mono, then the Thin Man wouldn’t exist, and the cycle wouldn’t keep repeating. I feel bad for Mono because there’s no way his young self would know that he was battling and saving Six from his adult self."
alliebeemac,Makes one wonder how long this Time-Loop has been going on years or maybe a century? And many times has Mono killed himself and been betrayed by Six?
alliebeemac,I am sorry to say he was stuck in that room for around 8 decades :(
alliebeemac,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXNUm9Mfvj4&amp;t=1h59m23s"">1:59:23</a> I Love the way you laugh. lol. sorry to Kasper though. Poor timing."
alliebeemac,The ending of the game is the start of the game and I’m not sure if you covered this but thin man or mono can travel through broadcasts and the broadcast can span from the beginning of tv so like the 1930ish to whatever time this is
alliebeemac,"Hey a11!! Just a heads up, I cannot stream tonight, but I will be streaming Nier Automata most likely tomorrow, 2/26. Hope to see you there!!"
alliebeemac,"I&#39;m curious, do you know about disco elysium(cRPG)? The full voice acting version is coming out this month and the written in that game is amazing."
alliebeemac,6 defenders are kinda weird. They&#39;d definitely never defend kids in real life who end up killing or doing extremely terrible things. They&#39;re just video game character simps
alliebeemac,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXNUm9Mfvj4&amp;t=2h20m45s"">2:20:45</a> I would love to play with you if you want. I would never be yelling at you."
alliebeemac,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXNUm9Mfvj4&amp;t=2h15m53s"">2:15:53</a> I do that too. I caught myself doing it and I have never been fancy either. America explain. LoL"
alliebeemac,This story requires a resolution. Really.
alliebeemac,Guess the dev changed their mind. It&#39;s a prequel. It&#39;s confirmed.
alliebeemac,Hey Allie would care for a friendly game of Rock paper scissors LoL. Jk.... unless. 😆
alliebeemac,Bruh why does it take you nearly twice the time of normal people to do things in his game geez🙄🙄🙄
alliebeemac,Nice gameplay
alliebeemac,allie whats your instagram?
alliebeemac,"Нихуя не понимаю, но очень интересно"
alliebeemac,I&#39;d like to suggest 2 games for you to play when you get the chance. One is Fran Bow and the other is Little Misfortune. They are both great and it didn&#39;t take long to find out why after starting them.
alliebeemac,"Wow you got a lucky bug, the thorns are supposed to hurt you in the lair, maybe Queen Headcrab hit you right between the hitbox or something idk."

alliebeemac,Who else remembers buying this game because the box said “doom beta included” and end up playing one of the most fun games out there?
alliebeemac,thank you for your reaction video i cried to when i beat the game so you are not alone
alliebeemac,Great!
alliebeemac,"I&#39;m sorry, I totally fell asleep for most of your stream. I haven&#39;t been feeling well as of late so I was super tired."
alliebeemac,👍👍👍
alliebeemac,"Your arguments against Avad make no sense. First of all the game takes place 6 months after the events of the first game, so his feelings for Ersa are no more; he moved on. Avad is also the only character showing that he has feelings for Aloy and is not bitching out about them. On top of that he does not like to bombard her with rewards and validations, he knows she hates that. Avad is the best choice. He ain&#39;t no creep. He has feelings for Aloy sure and wants to spend time with her. BUT, he values and respects her time and space to allow her to continue her mission. That&#39;s a chad right there. And Aloy doesn&#39;t seem to mind the idea of staying in Meridian either (heart choice). Also look at the facial expressions and body language Aloy shows towards Avad...she feels something for him and its not &quot;platonic&quot;."
alliebeemac,"Something I (in a kinda masochistic way?) enjoyed about Wolfenstein is it didn&#39;t sugarcoat or try to soften what the Nazis did, it shows you, full force, without mercy or care for your feelings, what they did to people. Great motivator to slaughter them by the hundreds."
alliebeemac,"I usually don&#39;t come back to longer livestream vods, but I find myself coming back to this one from time to time. Absolutely love your commentary and reactions! Dare I say, you have one of the best Wolfenstein playthroughs on YouTube!"
alliebeemac,"I don&#39;t play first person shooters. I don&#39;t enjoy watching people play them, but I loved this! <br>I came into this stream thinking &quot;I&#39;ll watch five minutes and dip&quot; I ended up watching for hours. Laughed my ass off through most of it.<br><br>The game itself was a shocker, I NEVER would have thought a game with the main dude just mowing people down with double machine guns would have me close to tears multiple times!<br><br>I love that they didn&#39;t shy away from the fact that Nazi&#39;s were horrific and not some cartoon super villain. The game was brutal at points.<br><br>These last few streams you&#39;ve shown me a glimpse into games I would read the title or description of and not even give a second look to when buying games and I love it! <br>Sorry for the long ass comment lmao."
alliebeemac,Summary... Allie really likes the main menu in this game.
alliebeemac,Kyle Weller is fucking hilarious everytime he donates it&#39;s always so funny
alliebeemac,That guy saying he wouldn&#39;t mind dating a hot blonde S.S. woman be like &quot;I can fix her bro&quot;
alliebeemac,Great Game! the old blood and the New colossus are good too
alliebeemac,U can only get the Jimi Hendrix thing if you save Wyatt
alliebeemac,"The reason the Nazis were probably so advanced in this time line is because they were. Kind of like the invention of the first rocket. The V1 V2 first war rockets that were already flying to the coast of Britain. That was unimaginable at the time. The Nazis and the German technicians consistently exceeded what was considered impossible with their technology. Which leads back to the work and perfectionist mentality of the Germans. Germany was called the land of poets and thinkers. That&#39;s really how it was known. I don&#39;t know why almost nobody knows about it anymore. But if you look at the inventions and poets of the Germans, you can see why. The first car, first computers, telephone, jet engine.<br><br>The simple reason why the Nazis have the atom bomb in this timeline is probably that the German scientists who invented the atom bomb in America had to stay in Germany. People like Albert Einstein. Thus, the Nazis were able to develop the atomic bomb first. To this day, historians are undecided on how close the Nazis got to the atomic bomb. In fact, the Nazis were close to development even WITHOUT the important scientists who then fled to America. But only in theory. The big problem was the resources. The Nazis fought against all major powers at the same time and therefore had no resources with which to build the atomic bomb. The resources, with the stupidity of Hitler and the high command, were ultimately the decisive point why the Third Reich fell. They had the strength, engineering and tactics. Strongest army in history. But Because of their own stupidity and greed, they fell. I wish Stauffenberg had made it..."
alliebeemac,"fergus is the better character in my opinion but sparing wyatt is the better choice. also, tekla’s death is way better than J’s. tekla kills a bunch of nazis on her deathbed and J only plays the star spangled banner really loud"
alliebeemac,The reason why blaskovich keeps talking to himself is because people who have PTSD often have an inner monologue to themself they&#39;re so used to keeping track of every single thing around them and talking to themselves about dangers my uncle has the same issue he&#39;ll Mumble under his breath to himself just assessing things around him

alliebeemac,"Damn this game keeps pulling out all the sad feelz,  this isn&#39;t the walking dead game,  guy did not have to sacrifice himself,   unnecessary deaths of friends 😖😖😖"
alliebeemac,It’s funny that at the start they are talking about d-day and she says “I don’t think this is how d-day happened” or something like that but it’s not even d-day as that happened in 1944 whereas this happens in 1946

alliebeemac,"Get psyched, i like how you dual wield, but then you keep shooting with one gun, good playthrough overall but its tilting when you talk over cutscenes."
alliebeemac,Oh gawd is some of this really true the torture
alliebeemac,"I didn&#39;t know this gonna be a emotional fucking game,  hopefully not like the walking dead series,  so far that was all kinds of fucked up"
alliebeemac,Also watching this first before the new game
alliebeemac,Sadly no one learned from the past cause there are terrorist attacks which is also fucked up
alliebeemac,It really bothers me how you dual wield and only shoot one of the guns

alliebeemac,"BJ&#39;s loveable because he superficially embodies a lot of stereotypically masculine traits (stoic, violent, strong, vengeful), but he either opposes, or is obviously damaged by the unhealthy sides of those stereotypes. He is compassionate, has a complex inner life, is clearly traumatized and emotionally repressed by his time as a killer.<br><br>Plus he hates nazis, who are all about rigid and unhealthy masculinity, and are obsessed with shallow aesthetics. He makes a great symbol of rejecting their ideology. Rather than enforcing the values he was seemingly raised with, he wants something better and freer for the future."
alliebeemac,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxaXVhvX9nw&amp;t=5h37m43s"">5:37:43</a><br>lol"
alliebeemac,"Odd question, but how does YouTube do with all Nazi Iconography that appears on screen during gameplay? They give you any trouble at all? Might be streaming the original game and they&#39;re all over the place."
alliebeemac,"Oooh this stuff is making me angry just like allie is angry  cause this is fucked up,"
alliebeemac,Hey 🥺
alliebeemac,MY father wanted to watsh legendary ww2 movie called unknown soldier the 1955 version and he fell asleep in midle of the movie and i had nightmares and i was fucking 5
alliebeemac,Just enjoy the story and stop repeating how bad the nazis were....we know that and no one thinks you are a sympathiser just because you dont always state your dislike towards nazis.
alliebeemac,"I really didn&#39;t know if I wanted to give this video a thumbs up or down because you&#39;re pausing sooo many times, it&#39;s irritating."

alliebeemac,Hey allie what’s your game of the year?
alliebeemac,When is ur next stream it’s been a while
alliebeemac,How do I get notifications when’s you go live and when is ur next live stream
alliebeemac,I saw that one of your red dead redemption live stream was taken down. It was the one that Arthur returned from guarma. Hope you didn&#39;t get a strike. So many others have that song in their video would be unfair that you get one.
alliebeemac,Allie are you there?? Cuz im worried about you being unavailable. 😥😢
alliebeemac,Do silver line
alliebeemac,Where you attt i misss youuu😩😩
alliebeemac,"Hi we are a very new channel that has gotten into gaming, do you have any tips to help grow our channel?"
alliebeemac,Please do the walking dead season 4 episode 3
alliebeemac,Hey u ok?
alliebeemac,I’ll show you my “Krampus” 😉 😂
alliebeemac,Hi
alliebeemac,Twdg e3 s4 ?
alliebeemac,I hate it
alliebeemac,Imma be 100% honest here- this video is a bit of a slog to get through because it&#39;s stuffed to the brim with exposition. Episodes after this one are much tighter and (imo) more interesting :P
alliebeemac,"It&#39;s nice to see you playing Pokemon. I am a lifelong Pokemon fan (of the games. I don&#39;t really keep up with the anime that much anymore). I&#39;m looking forward to more of your videos in this series, alliebeemac."
alliebeemac,nuzlocke are so fun you get a real bond with your pokemon. good job good luck with the run
alliebeemac,I played Pokémon when I was younger but haven’t heard of nuzlocke before! This seems interesting
alliebeemac,Allie Is A  Pokemon God And I Love your Voice Acting Allie great job Allie Keep up love you Allie
alliebeemac,So he knows about type advantages but still picked a grass vs. your fire. Smashing.
alliebeemac,"I wonder if Allie will be as fed up with Hop like me, by the end of the game 😅"
alliebeemac,Love you Happy Thanksgiving great gameplay
alliebeemac,I started with Scorbunny as well.
alliebeemac,I need you to make your character spin in place. Trust me on this.
alliebeemac,Omg Allie is playing Pokemon. I am freaking out! Omg omg omg
alliebeemac,I used to name my rival in Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal Asshole back in the day.
alliebeemac,"personally i would make it two per area, with having the keep the first one rule, i would have the most awful shittist pokemon in the game, i have very bad luck with rolling dice, chances with getting which pokemon, thats sounds bad."
alliebeemac,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XGVvoLb-0M&amp;t=40m17s"">40:17</a> It&#39;s because I dialed Niantic and asked them to give you some sponsorship training, you&#39;re welcome. lol"
alliebeemac,Happy thanksgiving! Btw you should really play fire emblem three houses.
alliebeemac,I would say your accent of Sonia is more of a merida accent
alliebeemac,Why did you only do 2 episodes
alliebeemac,You should name one of your pokemon Vernon
alliebeemac,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23GrookeyGang"">#GrookeyGang</a> because it’s the only one with good evolutions plus you stole purpleRodri’s idea in his Pokémon heart gold play thorough by naming your stater Zuko"
alliebeemac,Also there is no such thing as Brits or British as legally the uk/great Britain is not a country its a union of separate countries
alliebeemac,"If you guys have any feedback on the layout or format or editing let me know!! I want to know how to improve and how much of the game to cut out vs leave, etc."
alliebeemac,I think the mc&#39;s are Scottish
alliebeemac,NUUUUUUZZZZLOOOOOCCCCKKKEEEE
alliebeemac,Flash new means it expensive new fone
alliebeemac,Hi
alliebeemac,"Allie, I Like You And Your Games But I Don&#39;t Like Pokemon.<br>I&#39;m Really Sorry."
alliebeemac,"Easily my favourite stream you&#39;ve done so far! 10 / 10 Going straight into my favourites. 💜 (one slight criticism, I did find it being almost  14 minutes a little long... please strive for around 10 minutes in the future)"
alliebeemac,Was wondering literally the other day why Hades never continued and then this stream happens. Awesome.
alliebeemac,"Just found this a few days ago, burned through all of your Hades stuff. Thank you for a really lovely wholesome Underworld Family Time! Excited to watch you play more of it."
alliebeemac,Loved the patience you showed in that encounter.
alliebeemac,"Definitely I&#39;d LOVE more Hades for sure! And honestly, it gets even more searches than Ace Attorney or OMORI, which unfortunately, it is what it is! But if you and the others have any other ideas, for sure we can do them as well! I don&#39;t mind any of your ideas or the community&#39;s, they are great."
alliebeemac,Youre playing hades again thats so great im glad
alliebeemac,I&#39;m pretty sure you have to keep gifting Acchilles nectar until all his entries are filled in the rolodex and then you can progress the story between him and Patroclus.
alliebeemac,More Hades please!
alliebeemac,More hades please
alliebeemac,"Wait, Ive watch all the streams in the channel about the game, when and how happened Zagreus dating Meg?"
alliebeemac,Just got to watching this. What a bomb ass interesting game.
alliebeemac,Nice video!!!! I like how you are so good at delivering good videos we should call you ms. Delivery!!!!
alliebeemac,"I finished Celeste, but I think I gave up on strawberries, but I died in this game looooads of times. But game really has great plot and story."
alliebeemac,If only you streamed this and you would get so much donations from kyle
alliebeemac,alliebeemac I really freaking love you and have an amazing greatest cool day everytime
alliebeemac,Hi Alliebeemac! Your intro is hilarious
alliebeemac,"Oh Canada, our home and sacred land??"
alliebeemac,What happened to the AKA ?
alliebeemac,Hello again ma&#39;am
alliebeemac,"If Jk Rowling owned Rockstar : Arthur, I diagnose you with Homosexual"
alliebeemac,Mwahahaha
alliebeemac,hi again
alliebeemac,alliebeemac keep doing your thing girl sub at 4.4K
alliebeemac,❤️
alliebeemac,Artillary only? Regards from isp
alliebeemac,I know that I am the wrong generation but sad to hear your English has got a bit spicy.....
alliebeemac,Anyone who says the voice acting is bad is actually stupid. The voice acting is fantastic and they even got some well known British actors to voice for this game. But yeah it doesn’t take a genius to notice that the actors portray emotions very well.
alliebeemac,"Fiora:  &quot;Don&#39;t you care about me, I could have died!&quot;<br>Shulk:  &quot;You&#39;re not <i>hurt</i> are you?&quot;<br><br>Allie:   :o<br>Chat:   :o<br><br>Love it xD"
alliebeemac,"Yes, if you’re enjoying the game than please continue."
alliebeemac,The thing is people that play this the first time would never cry at that scene... it&#39;s supposed to make you mad<br>Rewatching or replaying it will make you sad tho
alliebeemac,I would absolutely love to see more! Its been a blast replaying this game I played it over only once and it was like right after I beat it like half a decade ago I loved experiencing it through new eyes
alliebeemac,Happy to see you covering this game! Loving the energy you got.
alliebeemac,"regarding sad books, the one that stands out most in my mind from my childhood was &quot;freak the mighty&quot; which followed 2 kids who were both outcasts at their school one of them was unnaturally strong but had mental problems, and the other was crippled but highly intelligent. they end up becoming friends and working together to accomplish the tasks that neither of them could alone due to thier issues. another one i remember was &quot;flowers for Algernon&quot; which was about a mentally handicapped boy who is given an experimental treatment to raise his intelligence which works, but the results are temporary which he finds out when &quot;algernon&quot; the lab mouse who had the treatment before him starts losing his intelligence and then dies"
alliebeemac,The voice acting is actually really top teir
alliebeemac,This looks like a great game am going to have to give it a try and great channel btw 💪
alliebeemac,This was really fun I think I fell asleep listening around the arch sage nopon but I’m watching now where I fell asleep :3<br>I love this game so much
alliebeemac,Shulk: <b>kills innocent grazing Dino beast</b> “I CAN FEEL THE STRENGTH!”
alliebeemac,"Hey you can REMAP arrows for skill selection to ZR and ZL<br>it makes the game so much better<br>the wii has unique controller which has analogue and dpad on a different hands so its really good back then"
alliebeemac,honestly i love it when games and shows make me feel like shit and then leave a pit in my stomach
alliebeemac,I like how it&#39;s the same exact person donating over and over again just to get his point across that he doesn&#39;t like the voice actors lmao
alliebeemac,Back here to reminisce and celebrate Xenoblade 3 getting announced!
alliebeemac,Ah yes the infamous &quot;trying to understand topple for a let&#39;s player&quot; part 1 of many<br><br>So many people fall into that trap lol
alliebeemac,The only reason people in chat say the voice acting is bad is because it is not some cliché american accent. Lol
alliebeemac,Donating to her is always fun as hell.
alliebeemac,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_la2ekMwkw&amp;t=59m24s"">59:24</a> Don&#39;t worry. The youngest of the party members (Shulk, Reyn, and Fiora) are all 18 years old."
alliebeemac,"I honestly don&#39;t see what good it&#39;d do in telling a person they&#39;re gonna die. All it&#39;d do is give them insane anxiety and constant fear and Shulk doesn&#39;t even know the events leading to the death moment go and neither will Sharla and Reyn, so he can only react to what&#39;s happening at that moment. Let&#39;s not forget every That&#39;s So Raven episode ever which she tries to change her visions and it just ends up happening exactly as she saw it"
alliebeemac,"Of course I would love to see you completing this game, but I definitely don&#39;t feel bad about you saying that you won&#39;t be finishing this game. It rely&#39;s heavily on inventory management and item crafting (Casual mode potentially makes this aspect of the game much less important). Xenoblade games are designed around stats more so than the average JRPG. I&#39;ve noticed that that tends to be something you don&#39;t enjoy as much so I wouldn&#39;t want to watch you suffer through mechanics you dislike. Another good JRPG that I think may be more of your style is Astral Chain. It&#39;s a very pretty steam-punk game and it has potentially one of the best real-time action battle systems I&#39;ve seen in any JRPG. Super fun to play, very good ratings by fans and critics, and it&#39;s not too long of a game. I know right now we&#39;re just filling the time with something until Last of Us 2 comes out, so I&#39;m excited for that!"
alliebeemac,"I don&#39;t wanna defend dumb writing, but actually Shulk might&#39;ve thought ahead alot when he thought about not telling sharla about her dying in the vision. Sharla would still go after Juju since its her brother but Reyn, being the overprotective bean that he is would probably try to stop Sharla from going which would result in needless fighting which might&#39;ve wasted so much time that they wouldn&#39;t even be able to get to Juju in time before he dies."
alliebeemac,For some reason her saying I was going to buy her a bikini makes me feel like that’s the greatest thing ever
alliebeemac,Lmao making an upskirt joke as Fiora is killed. Classic.
alliebeemac,"I just want to point out to the guy who said only ugly people can be bad and hot people are morally grey at worst...SPOILER ALERT<br><br><br><br><br>ZANZA, egli if that’s your type uhhh LORITHIA GAT DAWM"
alliebeemac,Oh yeah! Now it&#39;s Reyn time!
alliebeemac,"Ok so 2 things <br>1. I think it&#39;s funny that you said Max was a child and that&#39;s why she had a hard time getting people to listen to her while Shulk is a man so he should be able to command people... when they are exactly the same age. <br>2. I think some people played a different game than I did because in Life is Strange Chloe is just straight up a shitty person and a shitty friend who manipulates Max. Saving the town is the only option for me. I&#39;m not gonna sacrifice the life of thousands just to save one asshole just cause they were childhood friends. I understand that she is valid to feel hurt when Max left and never spoke to her again, but she is an asshole to her mom and Max. One specific example of why I think it&#39;s unreasonable is when you go to the diner for the first time and Kate calls you and Chloe basically says &quot;oh some girl you&#39;ve known for a week is more important than your oldest friend?&quot; like chill it&#39;s just a phonecall and if you can&#39;t stay inside for 5 seconds without arguing with your own mother then just wait outside or yah know act like a normal person and understand that Max has a life of her own that doesn&#39;t revolve around you.<br>I&#39;m not trying to argue with you. I think you&#39;re a cool streamer just wanted to give my opinion."
alliebeemac,"So many E-Girl JRPG walk throughs, so little time"
alliebeemac,its funny to me seeing you and the chat go of about how Shulk and Fiora look like children<br>because I&#39;m 22 and I look just about the same
alliebeemac,"I don&#39;t understand how people can read normally, but when it comes to learning how to read and learn to play in a videogame, their brains downgrade."
alliebeemac,&quot;I&#39;M REALLY FEELING IT&quot;
alliebeemac,I so want more
alliebeemac,"This dude on the chat is so stupid, Xenoblade is one of those game with an insane Dub.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_la2ekMwkw&amp;t=4h36m30s"">4:36:30</a> That&#39;s not a plot hole, you&#39;re going to understand way later on as to why he couldn&#39;t get this specific power before."
alliebeemac,I feel <b>aaallll</b> your anger at the JuJu and vision stuff omg
alliebeemac,"Inside the protagonist shulk edition,   Literally"
alliebeemac,"Going to be streaming again this *Wednesday be there or be square 😎✨<br><br>*i had previously said Tuesday, not knowing there was a blackout planned. I’m sorry for the confusion"
alliebeemac,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_la2ekMwkw&amp;t=2h59m45s"">2:59:45</a> Loss reaction"
alliebeemac,the guy who said the voice acting was bad :(
alliebeemac,"Ultimately I think Dickson might have turned out more shitty than Hulk Hogan. It&#39;s pretty close, though."
alliebeemac,Oh God even skipped the &quot;can&#39;t defeat a boss one&quot; I&#39;m sorry
alliebeemac,What is that like to dislike ratio lmao<br><br>Also I&#39;m a new viewer so I have no idea what the hell is going on. Just an old Xenoblade fan haha
alliebeemac,Shulk is 18 lol
alliebeemac,I just relaized what dickson meant by &quot;him&quot;
alliebeemac,I like this
alliebeemac,"Nm that scene with fiora showed exactly where your focus was, tutorials was NOT on the agenda"
alliebeemac,"Yeah I&#39;m sorry the amount of pausing and distraction is really disappointing, it detracts alot."
alliebeemac,Literally called reyn rain getting ign flashbacks
alliebeemac,"I thought I played slow but Jesus you play SLOOOOW. It’s welcomed (at least for me) though, especially because of your amazing commentary :)."
alliebeemac,Lost your mind over that $100 donation
alliebeemac,You could not save the people who are phantoms.  People are messing with you.  Phantoms are made from dead humans.
alliebeemac,Guys .... Yuir on ice
alliebeemac,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL_Cr4BmOE8&amp;t=56m58s"">56:58</a> you oof a lot?"
alliebeemac,Oh shi...poop! You&#39;re back!
alliebeemac,alliebeemac hello
alliebeemac,Wish you would figure stuff out yourself but oh well
alliebeemac,I won’t tell you whether any of them are right of course but I love your theories ^^
alliebeemac,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLkCuLKA67I&amp;t=1h39m58s"">1:39:58</a>   Allie almost dies laughing at my comment"
alliebeemac,Preventing poachers from hunting a species to extinction is a path to the dark side.
alliebeemac,"Oh wow we went for a long time last night I fell asleep at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLkCuLKA67I&amp;t=2m30s"">2:30</a> lol xD <br><br>Time to catch up"
alliebeemac,"Someone in the comment said this idk if you saw, but they compared this choice with the one Joel had when saving Ellie in the last of us. I think he/she made a great point. Me personally I couldn&#39;t bring myself to kill Chloe so I saved bae over bay I&#39;m selfish I know but to me there whole game was about saving Chloe and all the ups and downs were to make sure Chloe made it out alive. I&#39;m sorry Arcadia bay but Chloe comes first 😭😭😭 I&#39;m not strong enough"
alliebeemac,"Allie, do you know your commentary is amazing &amp; funny all the time &amp; I believe all of us are on your channel because of that."
alliebeemac,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsKBT3PufPk&amp;t=3h45m35s"">3:45:35</a> Start of Episode 5<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsKBT3PufPk&amp;t=6h58m20s"">6:58:20</a> The Last Decision"
alliebeemac,this game is so timeless!!! Thank you for the lets play... I played it years ago and always watch videos of it every so often..
alliebeemac,"You came into this game dead-set on picking one ending, and the game&#39;s story alone led to the other ending, not just by making the choice easy, *but by making it hard*. That&#39;s some amazing storytelling."
alliebeemac,That was really emotional. A brilliant game and awesome stream.
alliebeemac,"My further thoughts, since I always like to gush with you about emotional philosophy in great games:<br><br>-Max must have been so geared up to sacrifice herself, with reckless resolve.  She couldn’t have prepared herself for the possibility that it would cost other lives, and she couldn’t just absorb the consequences to be her own.  Hell, I would have bought a superhero costume by now, but she’s now cursed with never using her powers.  Knowing she can stop every mistake she makes.  Chloe is her reminder.<br><br>-Jefferson is probably preoccupied with the vulnerable gaze because he’s stopped trying to access it by earning love.  So he’s found a particular cheat to hack into people’s vulnerability.  All he had to do was show someone love.<br><br>-I just realized that Max could have pulled a Futurama and played out an entire life with Chloe and then gone back in time.  <br><br>-The time travel in this story is essentially travelling along your Light Line, your personal locus of time and possibility.  As such I’m not sure there should have been tornados and beached wales:  there’s no chance for paradox, just uncannily clever choices.  That being said the story made a masterful celebration of a different kind of strength:  sacrifice and love without vanity or might.  <br><br>-WAIT A MINUTE:  Why doesn’t telling them about the serial killings harm the timeline again?  She’s interfering with time by using knowledge only possible with time travel!  How is stopping Jefferson different than saving Chloe??<br><br>Much love to you."
alliebeemac,I always love the commentary your videos are so fun to watch and I&#39;m happy you played this game keep up the good work
alliebeemac,"She got those powers as soon as Chloe got shot, and she caused the natural disasters by creating false realities each time she saved Chloe or meddled with destiny.<br>Chaos theory is a true paradox time theory.<br>I got the whole soundtrack, the music is what made this super impactful as well<br>the worst part is the &quot;true&quot; Chloe will always feel Max and Rachel abandoned her :(;<br> Max Caufield should write a sci-fi/thriller series about her experience and to honor both Rachel and Chloe!<br>Alyssa gets killed in the storm, she was on the roof when you first entered the storm&#39;s chaos."
alliebeemac,LIS series is the best series that I played in this 5yrs.
alliebeemac,Your reaction at the end = my reaction too 😭
alliebeemac,i think alliebeemac needs to do a full playthrough of the Mass Effect series. MS3 Citadel DLC included.
alliebeemac,"So much better than the second game, it&#39;s unbelievable"
alliebeemac,"Hey so I know I shouldn&#39;t bring up other games since this video is specifically made for the game at hand, but I was wondering if you are ever planning on beating Ori and the Blind Forest. Or if you have already beaten it off camera."
alliebeemac,"Wait, context on the dislike for Garrus?"
alliebeemac,Can you play telltales the wolf among us series. It&#39;s excellent and something you might be into.
alliebeemac,Just got randomly recommended to this video.

alliebeemac,I love this game&#39;s opening scenes
alliebeemac,They warned me to bring an umbrella to protect myself from Alliebeemac&#39;s tears.
alliebeemac,How many years has it been and I still can&#39;t listen to our future days with out crying
alliebeemac,I know I&#39;m late to the party but you have an amazing sense of comedic timing.
alliebeemac,So we have two allie now. 😊<br>Both are super exciting characters.
alliebeemac,"Not a spoiler because I only started playing a few hours ago. I&#39;m only in the second &quot;chapter&quot; but I think the stuff that happened with Dina kissing Ellie and Joel going full dad to defend her happens after the trailer, but before the game actually begins."
alliebeemac,"Sorry that the steam crashed everyone! Here’s the continuation <a href=""https://youtu.be/ldRQXykTwfU"">https://youtu.be/ldRQXykTwfU</a>"
alliebeemac,Is this the sequal to the first? If so i thought this will release later on the year.
alliebeemac,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE8-ZF_ZRBI&amp;t=28m53s"">28:53</a><br>Ok I was wrong😂"
alliebeemac,Do these frame rate drops get fixed eventually?
alliebeemac,Test Deez nuts😂
alliebeemac,I&#39;m pretty sure they missed ten or more deaths from the 2nd last stream.
alliebeemac,"It&#39;s not &quot;the only Uncharted without mythical stuff in it&quot; (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIOgci0RSwo&amp;t=3h12m50s"">3:12:50</a>). Just, on a quick playthrough most miss in-game justifications.<br>First game (&quot;Drake&#39;s fortune&quot;) had creepy zombies but they were made that way by a dust-borne microbe afflicting those who opened a fabulous golden statue (moral: don&#39;t be greedy).<br>The second game (&quot;Among Thieves&quot;) had blue-skinned gorilla-like zombies which again were made that way by biochemical means, on consuming the blue resin which Cassie is shaking (moral: don&#39;t seek power for its own sake). She should totally administer that to Nadine one day.<br>The third (&quot;Drake&#39;s Deception&quot;) adapted an old semitic tale concerning a long-dead arabian city, variously called Ubar or Iram. This burg was supposedly abandoned after an evil Djinn imprisoned there cursed its people for excessive technological expertise; turns out in gameplay it was actually poisoned by a psychoactive drug leaking from a large container which Solomon threw into its water reservoir (moral: your cleverest innovations will kill you)."
alliebeemac,"** DROPS OUT OF WARP GATE ** Bebop here, poping here to say hello before I head to Mars City !! /waves."
alliebeemac,Yikes.
alliebeemac,So toxic
alliebeemac,Damn. I&#39;m sorry I miss the live stream😥

alliebeemac,aww missed a stream... piffles
alliebeemac,"Thanks to this video I had something to do for the main part of this Sunday<br>The more I see from this Game the more interesting it is for me. <br>I hope you will get better soon.  <br>You are doing a great work with your videos for me it’s always interesting, entertaining and educational."
alliebeemac,"I had the flu shot but a different strain of the flu got me,  went to royal Adelaide show, which translates to a fair or carnival,  with animals and activities and such,  but problem is tons of people go there so chances are I got given it by someone who didn&#39;t stay home when they should have,  luckily mum hasn&#39;t got it,  I was still feeling crap on the 9th so I was sick he same time as you allie I wonder if you had a high fever and chills like I did,  that part of it was not fun at all,  and the cough was  so annoying and painful,  it&#39;s now 15th sep so hopefully your feeling better now,  I haven&#39;t fully got rid of my cough though"
alliebeemac,"Every time I see Jesse Sheets drop major $$ on Allie, I keep flashing back to this Simpsons joke: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU3JLm1u5Oc"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU3JLm1u5Oc</a><br><br>Only, y&#39;know, in reverse."

JazzyGuns,"One day I&#39;m gonna join the custom show. I had fun being in Ego&#39;s lobby, the thing I hate when playing Fall Guys is the target grabbers like get off the game with that shit(grabbing is only ok if it&#39;s part of the course). Also for custom show you don&#39;t level up or if you win you don&#39;t get your crowns. <br><br>Ps: Lord Peppermint Is Great His Energy is awesome. Also, a weird food combos I love is Porkchop dipped into applesauce, Spinach/Corn on the cob with A1 sauce, Fries with pickle slices on top."
JazzyGuns,Girl said “kill me now” and God said “no less.” You spoke that into existence and God delivered by disconnecting you🤣💀☹️
JazzyGuns,I loved this live stream

JazzyGuns,More proof that Jazz adopts any protagonist she plays as
JazzyGuns,Mono: <b>*tries to be quiet*</b><br><br>Jazz: <b>SHUT UP!!!</b>
JazzyGuns,Jazz chasing the gnome to make it hug her 😂 that is some aggressive affection right there

JazzyGuns,"For Jazz and those who don&#39;t know, the wooden helmet is a reference to the character Mokujin (meaning &quot;wooden person&quot; in Japanese) from the &quot;Tekken&quot; franchise. Just some Bandai knowledge for you guys."
JazzyGuns,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zv8FPkCaNY&amp;t=3m40s"">3:40</a><br><br>Jazz: Imma call him baby wood!<br><br>Huge missed opportunity to name him Baby Groot! 🌿"
JazzyGuns,"Jazz, you make games a bazillion times more fun!!! Thank you so much!!! 😊"
JazzyGuns,The way she held her breath trying not to get caught by the gunslinger!
JazzyGuns,I&#39;ve seen her play the first one and I love how she talks to them sometimes ❤😁
JazzyGuns,Yo they make you feel so guilty when you die and Mono just stares at you all sad and depressed
JazzyGuns,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zv8FPkCaNY&amp;t=11m44s"">11:44</a> yeah Six without her raincoat worked really well it made some people think that its seven (the runaway kid) but turns out it was six."
JazzyGuns,Yay! I was ready to watch Jazzy play this!!! Let&#39;s get scared!
JazzyGuns,LETS GO!!!!!! I was so excited when I saw something about this game and I couldn’t wait to see you play it 😌
JazzyGuns,Jazzy is the third person I just watch play this game today. &amp; yet it doesn&#39;t stop being fun.
JazzyGuns,Jazz: ima call Mondo by whatever hat I get <br>Also Jazz: misses like 1 or 2 hats 😔
JazzyGuns,Jazzy is 100% the perfect parent for mono/wood baby (or baby wood).
JazzyGuns,Jazz I just wanted to say that you’re so funny every time you scream or something scary in the game happens I need to laugh.Stay that way.
JazzyGuns,Jazz made me laugh the whole time 🤣🤣
JazzyGuns,YES! I&#39;ve been wanting to watch someone play. I recently found your channel and I&#39;m so glad I can watch you play!
JazzyGuns,"FINALLY IT CAME OUT🎉🎉 I&#39;ve been waiting for a year, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zv8FPkCaNY&amp;t=35m35s"">35:35</a> you actually missed two hats one at the beginning of the house you have to go left instead of following baby no. 2 at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zv8FPkCaNY&amp;t=12m20s"">12:20</a> and one in the hanging cage once you jump over that bridge at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zv8FPkCaNY&amp;t=27m49s"">27:49</a>"
JazzyGuns,I&#39;m looking forward to this series! I love little nightmares! I can&#39;t wait to see all the different hats and names mono gets lol
JazzyGuns,"I just started playing this as well! It&#39;s very well done I feel, I love the music as always. Six feels strange without the raincoat. And some of the jumps have been hard for me 😅. Keep up the good work!"
JazzyGuns,"I just got Covid and my dad is in the hospital so I am pretty sad today but watching your videos always makes me smile, I really needed this 🙏🏽 thank you"
JazzyGuns,It&#39;s so cool that we get to see six again and it&#39;s like mono and six are a lil team
JazzyGuns,You have become my favorite game review channel. Yassss Jazz!
JazzyGuns,"You’re so persistent Jazzy, I would’ve rage quit trying to hug the nome after he kept disappearing lmao"
JazzyGuns,such a lovely video always makes the day better ♡
JazzyGuns,"Jazz thinking the second child is the kid from the DLC is hilarious, like girl did you not remember we witnessed his death lol"
JazzyGuns,YESSSS I’ve been waiting for this gameplay from you! 😁
JazzyGuns,I love you and CoryxKenshin so much. Y’all help me get through anything. So much love.
JazzyGuns,“”SHUT UP!”<br>LMAO😭
JazzyGuns,I needed this today! Thanks Jazzy!
JazzyGuns,Yes finally so glad this game finally out 🔥🔥🔥🔥&amp; the intro 😂 jazz yelling shut up sent me 🤣🤣🤣
JazzyGuns,Thank you Jazz! &quot;If they ask you for your rates ask them what&#39;s their budget.&quot; is def the motto I&#39;m keeping in mind.
JazzyGuns,“Exposure dont pay the bills”👏🏾
JazzyGuns,I love these quick and short Motivational videos they&#39;re so inspiring!
JazzyGuns,Exactly Jazz. A lot of content creators do not research these companies as well. The CC are happy about the sponsorship and get cheated/mislead at the end.
JazzyGuns,I 100% agree because there are some companies making some people do things against their will and if you don&#39;t do it you wont get applied
JazzyGuns,We appreciate you Jazz!!! Much love!!! My bro trying to get his channel up from the bottom and I appreciate your advice! ❤️
JazzyGuns,"Excellent advice! But, can I get the name of that background beat, tho?"
JazzyGuns,"We all thank you, Jazzy."

JazzyGuns,The stomping and jazz complaining about npc not helping and dying in the first 10 minutes 😂🤦🏻‍♀️ actually got real tears from Dwayne background
JazzyGuns,The hive mind deserves to be in the baddie hall of fame because it slays at attacking issac and jazz  and it accidentally kill Daniels she was true baddie
JazzyGuns,I love how the main objective for Isaac is finding his girlfriend and the impact of her fate is supposed to be a shocker but Jazz and chat don&#39;t care because they hate her
JazzyGuns,Thank you for reminding me to stay hydrated while working on my art school project throughout this game🤣🤣👍🌊🥛
JazzyGuns,"To Jazz’s credit, it took me a good little while to realize that you can dismember and dispatch the explosive necromorphs without destroying their explosive growths. Definitely feel her frustration watching this haha"
JazzyGuns,😂😂😂 “y’all gon’ take care of the baby? NO!”
JazzyGuns,"Well, hopefully once you finish your backlogs, Ace Attorney can join your list of new games to play afterwards."
JazzyGuns,She had my laughing so hard screaming relax and stop it stay there 🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
JazzyGuns,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeVGL7mn1dA&amp;t=39m39s"">39:39</a> - I have done NG and NG+ and not once did I think to check to see if I could enable fire suppression AND the elevator . . . the game conditioned me so well to think either/or . . ."
JazzyGuns,I gotta admit....i maybe took a few shots before the stream and the flat sprite wasn&#39;t helping at all so im sorry for the chat that saw me getting freaky
JazzyGuns,I got my Dreamcon ticket on the first drop! I&#39;m surprised they don&#39;t give the creators who are featured free tickets...
JazzyGuns,I wonder if she knows that each chapter spelled out Nicole is dead
JazzyGuns,Now next we gotta get jazzy to play Dark souls🤣🤣
JazzyGuns,Ego dies first every game thats played together 😂
JazzyGuns,Good you don&#39;t listen to the people just enjoy yourself
JazzyGuns,The back ground music reminds me of one of our childhood theme songs but cant remember which one 🤌🏾
JazzyGuns,Lol ....ain&#39;t trust everyone on the game <br><br>I felt like The&quot; We&quot; pronoun  don&#39;t exist in this game 💀😂<br><br>&quot;We did a  great team&quot;.....💀
JazzyGuns,It’s the stomping for me
JazzyGuns,"Got your friendz lol 😂 @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeVGL7mn1dA&amp;t=1h15m00s"">1:15:00</a>"
JazzyGuns,use the stasis and then shoot the harder to kill monsters!!!!!!!!
JazzyGuns,So no Force Gun?! Wow!! that was missed!! How come?!!! really??!!! One of the most powerful weapon in the game was not picked up?! Why?!!!
JazzyGuns,Alive side
JazzyGuns,😂
JazzyGuns,We all know we’re not here for the gameplay
JazzyGuns,Thank you you forget about gang game bang bang
JazzyGuns,Is jazz going to play hogwart legacy?
JazzyGuns,I don&#39;t know YouTube might be best for you what is you ever battle somebody I think you&#39;ll rip them apart like mortal Kombat or Street fighter battle I think you&#39;ll rip somebody apart is best to stay on YouTube you are too funny and too dangerous for the industry
JazzyGuns,"I could watch Jazz, The Queen of Fall Guys play all day!! Man, she&#39;s fantastic at this game!!"
JazzyGuns,who loves it when charlie says CLOWN 🤣
JazzyGuns,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3J3nI_tNkE&amp;t=1h04m17s"">1:04:17</a> You&#39;re welcome guys!...(RAGE MODE) LOL Jazz reaction was EVERYTHING! <br>This is what happened when you mess with Jazz gameplay...

JazzyGuns,Charlie singing Dynamite is a mood!!
JazzyGuns,I was here during the stream. Funniest stream ever and glad I didn’t miss it.
JazzyGuns,Charlie is the guy that kept foaming at the mouth every time aang came around🤣🤣
JazzyGuns,"HAHA Omfg I was legit crying when jazzy got murdered during slime climb <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3J3nI_tNkE&amp;t=1h04m15s"">1:04:15</a> 😂😂😂 her reaction made my morning lol best stream ever"

JazzyGuns,Jazz is a beast at this game
JazzyGuns,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3J3nI_tNkE&amp;t=16m38s"">16:38</a> Jazz killed that hexagon round"
JazzyGuns,Dwayne and robot pushed Charlie i&#39;m laughing so hard
JazzyGuns,It was funny seeing you and Dwyane hitting each other in the game
JazzyGuns,"If i had to choose tho I think Jazz would be Korra, Dwayne would be Zuko, Christene would be Suyin, And Charlie would be Varrick or Bolin"
JazzyGuns,Yo Jazz has gotta be the Fall Guys queen! Can I get you to join my team?
JazzyGuns,I got my first dub today after playing less than 15 games so i feel accomplished😁
JazzyGuns,Was at my brother&#39;s bday party so I sadly missed the stream. But great video as always Jazzy!
JazzyGuns,She is really good at the game
JazzyGuns,Jazzz is really good at fallguys
JazzyGuns,"Crazy how she has 62 crowns 👑, while I’m still sitting here with 1 and it’s the one they gave me for playing the game 😭😭💀💀💀"
JazzyGuns,"Hahahaha the look on her face in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3J3nI_tNkE&amp;t=56m23s"">56:23</a>"
JazzyGuns,Azula is the greatest character and you can&#39;t change my mind. Would love to be her.
JazzyGuns,Jazz plays this game so much doesnt even know the conveyor belt jump dive trick in whirlygig
JazzyGuns,"Charlie’s vocabulary:<br><b>CLOWN</b><br>YO [Insert name] I WAS PLAYIN<br>That wasn’t me, that was [Insert name]"
JazzyGuns,I don’t know why the name Sloth the sinful makes me laugh so much
JazzyGuns,We not going to talk about yesterday but y&#39;all gotta do better! 😏 Y&#39;all need to take Corey  to Japan with y&#39;all
JazzyGuns,This is the best group ever
JazzyGuns,Jazzyguns 💪💪🏀 ✌️ is a pretty good at this game
JazzyGuns,after them saying “oh you served” my slow self figured out what the real meaning of USAF. idk why it didn’t click at first😭
JazzyGuns,Jazzy on the whirlygig u can climb by going to the side and pressing x then your right bumper which makes ur character climb.
JazzyGuns,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3J3nI_tNkE&amp;t=29m35s"">29:35</a> Charlie famous quote"
JazzyGuns,"When I join the Air Force in the next few months, I&#39;m gonna start saying I&#39;m United States As F*ck.🤣🤣 I love this group🤣🤣"
JazzyGuns,I missed the stream I was biking riding😞. This was good tho!!!❤️❤️💜
JazzyGuns,when she said &quot;Get it monkey! Get it monkey!&quot; I died HAHHAHAHA
JazzyGuns,"Hey, have any of you tried Among Us?  The concept is like a space themed Dead by Daylight, only the murderer looks like the other characters, so the survivors have to figure out who the murderer is before they are all killed."
JazzyGuns,He said it’s called “drip too hard” 💀
JazzyGuns,I MISSED ANOTHER LIVE 😭😭😭😭😭💔
JazzyGuns,Remember to love God everyday! ❤️
JazzyGuns,"Love this video 😁<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>"
JazzyGuns,I love you jazzy💛
JazzyGuns,Lately I’ve been watching every stream for the whole time lately
JazzyGuns,They gotta react to Game Theory&#39;s new video on Fall Guys
JazzyGuns,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3J3nI_tNkE&amp;t=1h31m25s"">1:31:25</a> LMAOOOOO"
JazzyGuns,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3J3nI_tNkE&amp;t=28m03s"">28:03</a> &quot;banana go brrrr&quot; lmao"
JazzyGuns,Jazz play this game all day
JazzyGuns,Bro I never knew jazzy knew aychirstine!
JazzyGuns,I had to blow up Captain Crunch.....I just had to 😅😅
JazzyGuns,She really had a &quot;f*ck this--I have a rocket launcher&quot; moment with Captain Crunch. 😂
JazzyGuns,Jazzy: Imma use my rocket launcher cuz I lost all my ammo<br>Me: Ya could’ve used that from the start😂😂😂
JazzyGuns,Gotta give Salazar some credit. He’s the only boss so far that forced her to use the rocket launcher.
JazzyGuns,"If Jasmine loves Ada so much, she&#39;ll have a field day in RE 6"
JazzyGuns,"When she shot him off that ladder, screamed &quot;SI&#39;DOWN&quot; and he <b>flew</b> I started cryin 😂😂💀"
JazzyGuns,"I love how your consistent with your videos, it keeps me tune in 👍"
JazzyGuns,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GveMxJ4AJ4w&amp;t=23m57s"">23:57</a> Literally me anytime I get to that boss fight. It&#39;s hands down the most frustrating, ridiculous, and overpowered boss in the entire game."
JazzyGuns,"Hey jazzy next time if you ever play the part where you had to kill that creepy monster with the key card, just shoot him in the leg which causes him to fall and you can shoot the last plague heart easier 👍"
JazzyGuns,"You&#39;re my #1 female YouTuber. You keep me immersed in the games you play, you&#39;re never cringey (even when you try and rap to the music), and you&#39;re never fake when it comes to how you react to events. Keep on keepin&#39; on."
JazzyGuns,"So Jazz do you know that if you see the people with the plagas coming out of their heads, or the ones that break off from their necks and scurry around, you can throw a flash grenade at them and they INSTANTLY die? Saves on you having to waste ammo."
JazzyGuns,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GveMxJ4AJ4w&amp;t=23m56s"">23:56</a> Yep, the rocket launcher is perfect for this fight to be honest!!! Awesome gameplay 🙌💪"
JazzyGuns,I was waiting for her reaction when the guy pops out of the big oven and grabs you. That nearly gave me a heart attack the first time I played it.
JazzyGuns,"Jazz&#39;s reaction to the Regenerador was fucking amazing. I mean, people probably have that reaction to seeing them for the first time 15 years later."
JazzyGuns,I was cracking up the whole time 😂
JazzyGuns,"I’m just post to be a regular cop , saving people I’m over here running from captain crunch statues and everything🤣 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GveMxJ4AJ4w&amp;t=7m08s"">7:08</a>"
JazzyGuns,"One of the most greatest, iconic, memorable, and scariest level in the whole entire game as it was just constructed perfectly from the very beginning of the end as the astomphere and tension is so creepy, spooky, eerie, dark, sinister, intense, and unnerving which gives the player a sense of dread, agony, hell, pain, despair, and trauma of what they have to endure as it&#39;s such a nail-biting thrill ride as it keep you on the edge of your seat.😱😰"
JazzyGuns,You know Jazzy means business when she pulls out the magnum 😂😂😂
JazzyGuns,Jazz u be killing me when u call him captain crunch 😂
JazzyGuns,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GveMxJ4AJ4w&amp;t=35m21s"">35:21</a> Best moment Period😭😭😭 Bruh."
JazzyGuns,“Why caption crunch why”that part had me dying love this channel though😂
JazzyGuns,"When Leon collects gold stuff, makes me want to find gold too"
JazzyGuns,Currently going through my professional run. Also don&#39;t worry just about everyone saves the rocket for him.
JazzyGuns,jas: is ada gonna be my partner now?<br>me: <b>you gotta wait for.... 15-20 years for ada to finally stop playing mind tricks on him first</b>
JazzyGuns,Jaz: <b>Using shotgun on a boss at long range not really doing any damage</b><br><br>Me: <b>Staring at the whole ass rocket that she&#39;s had in her inventory for like the past four videos</b> <i>&quot;use iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittttttttttt&quot;</i>
JazzyGuns,Jasmine tryna shoot the back of the Iron Maiden is funniest part in this video🤣🤣
JazzyGuns,Just when we thought it was over BUT Jaz still gets 10s for going through these digital struggles
JazzyGuns,You&#39;re reaction with the regenerators had me dying 🤣 you are awsome
JazzyGuns,"just as a tip, flash grenades instantly kills the Plagas that sprout from enemies, so if you&#39;re surrounding by enemies with those insect tentacle things (like from their heads or the wolves) , they&#39;ll die if you throw one. That way you don&#39;t waste as much ammo by shooting each one"
JazzyGuns,"I am wondering what RE game jazzy will play after this, it would be funny to see her play RE5 and be in africa fighting zombies, RE6 so she can see sherry leon and ada in the same game again or RE Revelations 2 so she can play as claire and continue to deal with younger characters just like ashley 🤣"
JazzyGuns,Jazz u crack me up every time u say captain crunch lol.
JazzyGuns,Jazz vs Captain Crunch<br>Jazz: Give me your eye!!!!!<br>AHHAHAHA one of the best line &lt;3
JazzyGuns,&quot;Now I&#39;m playin&#39; donkey kong with captain crunch&quot; <br><br>Lmao!
JazzyGuns,The statue part was the hardest part for me in professional mode I broke a class cup by accident
JazzyGuns,Am I the only one who loved the inventory system in this game?
JazzyGuns,pls do more jasmine we love it keep it up girl
JazzyGuns,Whoever designed the regenerators and iron maidens can truly design the things only nightmares can conjure up
JazzyGuns,"I&#39;m surprised Jazzy waited so long to use the Rocket Launcher. I used it the first instant his human form opened up to me when I play against that boss. I don&#39;t play and try to figure out THAT headache of a boss, I just one shot the mutated midget.<br><br>Edit: Jazzy....it would be a LOT easier to shoot their backs if you shoot off a leg from one of the Regenerators and Iron Maidens."
JazzyGuns,The fact that my cousins played this game while the screen was so dim they thought that the game is like that until they realized that the tv was broken 😂
JazzyGuns,Your commentary alone is entertaining af
JazzyGuns,I laughed so hard when she shot the window out first before the plaga 😂😂
JazzyGuns,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GveMxJ4AJ4w&amp;t=49m52s"">49:52</a> hilarious how she all of a sudden remembers it&#39;s possible to combine the sniper rifle and a scope 💀"
JazzyGuns,"Hi Jazzyguns, you playing this game is quite entertaining. Keep up the good work. See you in part 9"
JazzyGuns,I love how Jazz says you got any you guns and immediately after she pass the minethrower she says no 😂
JazzyGuns,"Lol! Excellent gameplay as usual, Jazzy. But I do have one pro-tip for you. Turn to the enemies first and THEN aim. Leon turns slower while you&#39;re holding down the aim button."
JazzyGuns,Just an FYI; you can shoot off the regenerators&#39; legs to temporarily slow them down (This also exposes their backs).
JazzyGuns,"I love Jazzy as much as I love Ada, but every time she uses the magnum pistol for the regular zombies I feel a little upset bc it&#39;s the most powerful gun in the game and I usually use it against bosses only. It&#39;s just a waste for me😂 but Idc bc it&#39;s Jazz. Her contents entertain me😅😀❤"
JazzyGuns,THEY ARE HERE!!! Yes!!! Been waiting for this part. Love your gameplay for this game.
JazzyGuns,Lol loving the nicknames first Captain Crunch now Borderland lol🤣
JazzyGuns,That was a  awesome video keep up the good work jazzy💗
JazzyGuns,"Posting for those who missed it, hopefully it helped some of yall, and Happy Pride! 🌈"
JazzyGuns,You always give amazing advice Jasmine!😀
JazzyGuns,Keep up with the uplifting messages they really brightened my day like I know they do for plenty of others
JazzyGuns,"To the person who asked if they should come out to their mom, if you believe your mom will abuse you, kick you out of the house, or out you to family or others who might harm you, you do not have to come out to her just because it&#39;s pride month. If you feel safe and comfortable doing so and think your parents will support you then all power to you. Just remember you don&#39;t have to come out if it affects your safety."
JazzyGuns,"Thank you for answering my question <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ggxUbvzuCM&amp;t=9m39s"">9:39</a>  <br>It was great advice  I appreciate it alot. 💙"

JazzyGuns,I have a feeling Jasmine would enjoy this game way more if there were snacks
JazzyGuns,After you clear the game redo the homeless chapter and help them (do Stan in last) and search the hospital room to get information about the homeless and the teenagers.
JazzyGuns,Did anyone got goose bumps when she said “come to me my servant” 😱

LDShadowLady,"I watch these whenever I&#39;m bored or down. I miss these videos. But it&#39;s her choice, she can take her time for another year and I will support her. 💕"
LDShadowLady,Lizzie <br>You are the best you always make me smile <br>Even on sad days. My dog died this year and you cheered me up in my hardest times<br>Thank you for what you are doing. Keep making me smile.

All your funny jokes happy smiles and never ending videos always cheer me up when ever I am down in the dumps. Your fans will be proud of you with what ever you do just remember. I was a fan ever since the beginning and as soon as I knew your channel existed I subscribed. The reason I found out about was because of Amy Lee 33 when I watched a video on her channel about you and her doing a Halloween map I saw the other girl she was playing with ( you) and decided to watch one of her videos for the first time. Just remember your fans are always going to like your videos and that you just try your best on what ever you do and never give up"
LDShadowLady,"Dear Lizzie,<br><br>You are my inspiration. I can always count on you to make me happy and laugh. You may never notice me but if you did I would literally cry happy tears. xD Thank you for being such an inspiration not only to me, but to a lot of other people. We love you, Lizzie!&lt;3"
LDShadowLady,"Dear Lizzie, Your vids are awesome. NEVER let haters make u sad. U are unique in ur own way. - Shyla"

LDShadowLady,"Lizzy, use your number keys (1,2,3) for the digging part. It&#39;s much easier! :)"
LDShadowLady,"Lizzie, you should do a series kinda like Shadowcraft, except have it with Joel. I think it would be really fun!!"
LDShadowLady,Aww Buddy is in the background just chilling 😂

LDShadowLady,I&#39;m so excited Lizzie! I know it seems far away but you only need 47K to get to 1 millions!
LDShadowLady,"Who else is rewatching this video in 2023, where Joel and Lizzie are happily married. That&#39;s crazy."
LDShadowLady,"to you. ya you. were you feeling sad today? well please don&#39;t. you&#39;re pretty, smart and be confident because the people bringing you down are below you. just take a second to smile, you&#39;ll hopefully feel better, if you don&#39;t just think about how many people care about you, including me :) thanks for listening &lt;3"

LDShadowLady,Please do more Minecraft VS. with Joel. I love that series
LDShadowLady,Lizzie you really do make my day.YOU are my favourite yter ever!!!!!!!!I love your yt channel so keep up the good work!!
LDShadowLady,I though buddy was a pillow and when he moved it stared me so much 😂🎉💃🏽❤️<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Also anyone watching in 2017?
LDShadowLady,Yay congrats for winning Lizzie &lt;3
LDShadowLady,"Lizzie, you probably won&#39;t respond but here is a tip for the canon-fire party game:<br>You shift and stand off the back edge in the corner and the canons cant touch you."
LDShadowLady,"Just putting it out there, did anyone see the Pepsi bottle (in the background on her bedside table) in the Barclay life skills shoutout 😂"
LDShadowLady,I LOVE your videos ^.^  Thanks For The Laugh!
LDShadowLady,Gd job Lizzie!💕
LDShadowLady,"LIZZIE DID YOU KNOW THAT MICHAEL CLIFFORD FOLLOWS YOU ON TWITTER, BECAUSE I&#39;M DEAD."
LDShadowLady,Omg your so close to 1 million I&#39;m so proud of you!
LDShadowLady,"I’m half Salvadoran so when she says El Salvador I get really happy, since no one talks about SAL!🇸🇻❤️(This is the 100th time watching this series!❤️)"
LDShadowLady,"I take the comments from the lastest Shadowcraft I uploaded, and I take the speedcaps at the time I record the video, Sometimes this is just a day or two after the video came out, sometimes it&#39;s later. I try to get a variety though! :)"
LDShadowLady,* El Salvador seems happy with his environment.<br><br>* +1 happiness received!
LDShadowLady,Ironic that she named the donkey &quot;El Salvador&quot; which translates to &quot;The Savior&quot;
LDShadowLady,"Oh lizzie lizzie, little do you know that in the future, you need no mods for your beautiful dyed beds...<br><br><br>It&#39;s the most annoying thing ever"
LDShadowLady,"Remember back when dying beds had to be a mod.. painful, painful days."
LDShadowLady,I love the editing in these lol. Not to mention Lizzie&#39;s actually entertaining where a lot of other people just babble while doing boring stuff in solo play.<br><br>....<br><br>I want Minecraft now.
LDShadowLady,when lizzie first got steve:<br><b>too scared to touch him</b><br><br>now:<br><b>rides steve up the side of a freaking mountain.</b>
LDShadowLady,Anybody else having a Shadowcraft marathon in 2016 because Lizzie&#39;s amazing??
LDShadowLady,"The funny thing is, she has two normal saddles in one of her chests!"
LDShadowLady,Give Steve a custom cave for him to live in and get other pet scorpions for him to have company
LDShadowLady,Lizze: we&#39;ll only get a couple more goats<br>future Lizze: <b>has like 20 goats excluding the ones that died</b>
LDShadowLady,"Little did Lizzie know, but in 2018 we have the beds already coloured."
LDShadowLady,I hope she does a season two so I can watch it over again!
LDShadowLady,I always rewatch shadowcraft and each time I laugh more then I should when you push El Salvador in quicksand.
LDShadowLady,Crazy to think 4-3 years after this series dyed beds became a REAL addition to minecraft and now Cherry blossom trees are on the way!
LDShadowLady,"Beautiful video, thank you for doing what you do :)"
LDShadowLady,I love that lizzie first hated Steve and is now like &quot;aww Steve came to lay with me&quot;
LDShadowLady,I&#39;m pulling a Shadow-thon!!! Watching every shadow craft video all in one night!!! I just can&#39;t stop watching...sooooooo...tired 😑
LDShadowLady,You should cover the top of the water with glow stone then it will really light it up. The darker it is though the cooler the gelly fish would look so you could get more of them and it will light it you as well! 
LDShadowLady,"Always have the episodes be this long, I love the long episodes of this awesomeness c: "
LDShadowLady,I’m like rewatching this series for the 3rd time I will always be a shadow cadet!
LDShadowLady,"Either an Elephant Paradise where you can make like a waterfall and a spring and stuff and make it all sandy, or a really nice horse stable with glorious stallions. Either way you should name one Jack :)"
LDShadowLady,"8 years later i still miss steve, he will be remembered."
LDShadowLady,This is the best episode:<br>She said Jehovah&#39;s Witness (I&#39;m a witness)<br>She said my name - Beth<br>My real life fish is called fluffy (it&#39;s dead now 😞)<br>Love this episode!!!!!!
LDShadowLady,You should expand the goat paradise and have the big fishtank out in the open - like visible from all sides
LDShadowLady,The orange isn&#39;t that bad. It looks pretty good! I&#39;m glad you chose orange:)
LDShadowLady,I named my favorite daughter on Sims 4 Crystal!
LDShadowLady,You should definitely have a bunny paradise! It would be so cute :3
LDShadowLady,Thanks  for all the amazing  things you do
LDShadowLady,Don’t mind me just rewatching the series 😚
LDShadowLady,You should add some glow stone to the back wall inside the fishy tank to make it brighter :)
LDShadowLady,The editing on these videos are pure gold
LDShadowLady,Lizzie: I refuse to kill you.<br>Also Lizzie: I will kill all of the cows!<br>Lol. I love your videos! I’m also rewatching this for the 3rd time.
LDShadowLady,that was so sweet of you by saving the donkey/mule and keeping it as a pet!
LDShadowLady,the badge for being a shadow cadet is having watched this series more than 10 times😭😭
LDShadowLady,I&#39;ve always heard about LDShadowlady but never checked her out. I love this!!!! Subbed!
LDShadowLady,you should light the whole floor of the fish tank it would make it way lighter<br>Love this series its funny and awesome
LDShadowLady,Jojo would be such a cute goat name! Loving Shadowcraft :)
LDShadowLady,Ok did you guys here that Lizzie compared a Jehovah’s Witness to a ghost that was by her door to be honest I just laughed so hard and I am a Jehovah’s Witness so this was hilarious 😂.
LDShadowLady,I love this series :) You should tame Birds. Your Awesome
LDShadowLady,i know that the turtles live in the barn but you could try making a little paradise for them so they aren’t as cramped inside that little space :))<br><br>edit. i just realized that this was made 8 years ago whoops
LDShadowLady,El Salvador is where my family is from :D
LDShadowLady,"I like how Lizzie saved Steve, and at first she didn&#39;t even like him. Now every episode I look for him to appear in the video and see how she will react to him."
LDShadowLady,"You could have a horse paradise, or a kitty paradise. They both fit your personality in a way."
LDShadowLady,You should bring back shadowcraft and make different areas from biomes and put the animals inside of them from the biome!! Also if you do can you name a black and white bunny Kenzie?? Or maybe Sammy??
LDShadowLady,Great job once again! Your videos always make me smile!<br>~CK
LDShadowLady,"Lizzie, you should’ve nicknamed yourself El Salvador, because it actually (roughly) means The Savior. You saved the donkey, so you should be El Salvador!"
LDShadowLady,"Why not build Steve his own little pimped out house? XD you can get him a lady friend and they can have a beautiful weird family. by the way if you ever named a kitty, goat or fish after me. My middle name is Yasmin"
LDShadowLady,Loving the longer length of shadowcraft
LDShadowLady,Can&#39;t wait for your enchanted oasis!
LDShadowLady,"He either found a mob (like Cave Spider or Enderman), a mineshaft, or Diamonds. Most likely a mineshaft."
LDShadowLady,What happened to fractions and you should make a survival series with Joel 
LDShadowLady,I know I&#39;m really late but I think it would be a good idea to get flint and steal and for the death match just light people on fire and then hit them
LDShadowLady,"I really like this series,can&#39;t wait for more AWESOME adventures!!!^-^"
LDShadowLady,You are doing great Lizzie!! Keep up the good work!! &lt;3 &lt;3
LDShadowLady,You should defend when you are able to attack because if you use bows and they use swords you&#39;ll have the advantage :) if you make a sky base it&#39;ll be easier to bow them.
LDShadowLady,"Is it just me does anyone else go into a cave on mincraft and find a dead end, then get angry and be like &gt;:( im taking my torches back! -_-  Then  later realizes, &quot;Oh yaaaaah mobs.....&quot; <b>fights off like 28 mobs</b> i thinks its just me xD"
LDShadowLady,Thank you for being you and making amazing videos &lt;3
LDShadowLady,who else thinks Joel and Lizzie should have been pared?!
LDShadowLady,"&quot;There is a zombie down there, but it looks friendly!&quot; The famous last words of Zack Scott."
LDShadowLady,that cliff hanger tho lucky for me the playlist is complete 2016!
LDShadowLady,He mightve found a dungeon. A cave with a lot of gravel means theres a pretty good chance of one .
LDShadowLady,I love this series! Pls do it more often
LDShadowLady,such a cliffhanger Lizzie
LDShadowLady,"lizzie&#39;s thoughts on mineshafts worries me, i dont think i ever found more then 3 chests throughout the whole time ive played minecraft and none of them had anything worth taking.... and mineshafts have butt loads of poisoness spiders and everything bad o.o"
LDShadowLady,"If you use gold blocks instead of ingots to make a golden apple, you get a super golden apple and your health will last a lot longer. <br><br>           Hope It Helps!"
LDShadowLady,Who else saw Lizzie walk right past the gold?
LDShadowLady,You&#39;re an awesome YouTuber! Keep making videos! 
LDShadowLady,girl you can win this
LDShadowLady,Do more episodes on ultra hardcore you make me inspired so much and ps makes sure things don&#39;t go too OP! LOL<br>
LDShadowLady,you should get golden apples and eat them to regenerate your health :)
LDShadowLady,Cliff Hanger ! You got me :) Didn&#39;t see that one coming.
LDShadowLady,I love this series!!!!!
LDShadowLady,I love all your videos! Your such an amazing person 💜💜
LDShadowLady,"For future information, u need exactly 25 iron to craft a full iron armor set, same with gold, diamond sect"
LDShadowLady,I love this series ! Btw is there another way to get cape or can you only get it at minecon
LDShadowLady,You guys should have been team Zack Lady 😂
LDShadowLady,Lizzie: do you need some help?<br><br>Zack: (or Scott 🤔) no I was just trying to make torches in the furnace.
LDShadowLady,At the end of the video I threw my phone across the room. Atherkotohlglfjdidjjfkp!
LDShadowLady,when are you going to start playing enchanted oasis? I have been really looking forward to seeing you play it.
LDShadowLady,Did anyone one else notice Zack said &quot;we can bake iron&quot;?
LDShadowLady,is anyone else amazed that Lizzie and zackscott found a ravine in a ravine
LDShadowLady,The ending made me wanna cry alittle...<br><br><br><br><br><br>In other words I think he probably found a spawner!
LDShadowLady,Lizzie I love ur videos ur my fave minecrafter
LDShadowLady,Zack: &quot;I Have 15 Iron&quot; He Says Triumphantly.<br>Lizzie: &quot;Yeah Well I Have 24&quot; She Says Bluntly XD
LDShadowLady,"Lizzie can you upload often more, I totally understand if you don&#39;t have any time I&#39;m just asking."
LDShadowLady,"Ok so i now believe that you didnt make me set on fire lizzie, i just cannot understand why i randomly set on fire from my PoV :("
LDShadowLady,"“I have 15 iron we can BAKE” - ZackScott, 2014 👏🏻"
LDShadowLady, U should check ur coords in case ur under someone&#39;s base thing<br>
LDShadowLady,Wow what a cliffhanger. I&#39;m dying over here.
LDShadowLady,Love uhc!!!
LDShadowLady,Are you going to continue factions? <br><br>Or start uploading the magical oasis 
LDShadowLady,zombies can also drop carrots sometimes
LDShadowLady,Such a cliffhanger though !!!!😂☺️
LDShadowLady,YES YOU TWO CAN WIN THIS!!!!! I hope...... lol
LDShadowLady,Nice ending ! : )
LDShadowLady,the ending is awesome I loved it the first time I watched this seires
LDShadowLady,why did you stop minecraft factions? I loved that series :)
LDShadowLady,I heard that if you right click an item on a Christmas tree the item can be a decoration<br><br>P.S I love your videos
LDShadowLady,I think your house is beautiful. I love how you incorporated the trees into the roof.
LDShadowLady,"I think your house looks amazing, really, awesome! Its beautiful. Also, i love this series!"
LDShadowLady,I love the series so far thank you for making a channel! 😁 😉
LDShadowLady,"You should use the light spell on the Christmas tree, So it will look like fairy lights<br>&lt;3 ~Eleanore"
LDShadowLady,"Plz bring Enchanted Oasis back! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23returnofenchantedoasis"">#returnofenchantedoasis</a>"
LDShadowLady,"If Aria penguin is anything like Arya Stark, she&#39;s going to be a BADASS"
LDShadowLady,LDShadowLady You should put pressure plates just inside your doors so they close automatically whenever you come or go. Saves you time and having to remember to close them. :)
LDShadowLady,You all should probably do like a christmas special were you collab and give each presents and have a feast. That would be nice. :)
LDShadowLady,"Hey, Liz, thanks for this episode! That lights spell was super pretty. By the way, my name&#39;s Lizzy, too, and I was wondering if you spell it the same way as my mine? Oh, and when are you gonna name your owl? I have some suggestions: Odessa, Hoot, Olive, Olivia, Oliver, Feathers, or Orin. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a boy or a girl."
LDShadowLady,I love this series please continue it!!
LDShadowLady,"You should put pressure plates on the inside of your house in front of doors, so they close automatically for you, and open too. BUT, DO NOT put them on the outside because then mobs, animals, snowmen, etc. can get in."
LDShadowLady,Don&#39;t you have a penguin in Shadowcraft 2.0 named Tux? 🐧
LDShadowLady,I love this series!
LDShadowLady,Loved this episode :D ♥
LDShadowLady,i dont really care if the house is a fantasy theme or something you still have an awesome house
LDShadowLady,"Next episode you should get the girls together and make a huge Christmas tree, decorate it, then place multiple presents under it that you can open on Christmas! (Maybe even before/after Christmas because real life lol)"
LDShadowLady,I literrally just posted on the last video wanting the series to come back not realizing that there were more episodes not in the playlist. IM SO HAPPY NOW ENCHANTED OASIS LIVES
LDShadowLady,"Can you name a penguin Flippers , SnowFlakes or Skittles ? "
LDShadowLady,This is one of my most favorite series :)
LDShadowLady,You should make the jukebox into a stereo. And donate the duplicate butterflies to the butterfly trading shop thing.
LDShadowLady,you should also cover your house in vines it would look really pretty
LDShadowLady,"If you get more name tags, you should named a reindeer Jingle!"
LDShadowLady,"She should&#39;ve named the deers like Santas reindeers (e.g Rudolph, Vixen, Comet)"
LDShadowLady,The first thing I thought of when she named the penguin Aria was Aria Montgomery from Pretty Little Liars.
LDShadowLady,"LD,you can just put pressure plates on the inside of your house so then you can just walk out and you don&#39;t have to worry about closing them!<br>"
LDShadowLady,Use pressure plates on the inside of the door and they&#39;ll automatically close
LDShadowLady,I  am a shadow cadet and I really like enchanted oasis could you consider making more so I can keep watching?? You are the youtuber that I ink gives us the most fun things to do and I really love to watch you so please keep this series going 😋
LDShadowLady,Just spawn in nametags and name them in creative :) I&#39;m sure everyone is fine if you just spawn them in :D
LDShadowLady,"If she ever kept  a snowman, I would want her to call it derp"
LDShadowLady,"Snow flake, fluffybutt, frosting, or Snow White! Please name your animals one of these!"
LDShadowLady,I love this series! Btw could you name a penguin flop :)
LDShadowLady,"Could you name a deer Fawkes or Delia, I would love it if you got started with the Witchery mods and gave Joel a tour of the world :)"
LDShadowLady,Please don’t end the series
LDShadowLady,"You should put the &#39;fairy lights&#39; spell you made and put it on/around the Christmas tree to make it look like Christmas lights. You should also name a penguin 🐧 Gunter, Gunther, Happy Feet, or all of the names of the penguins from Mr. Poppers penguins. (Bitey, Stinky, Lovey,Captain, Nimrod, and Loudy) 🐧❤👍(≧∇≦)/"

LDShadowLady,"You coming in first for the smoke monster game really suprised me, too! Not because you&#39;re a bad player, just because I was focusing on the game and not on the players! "
LDShadowLady,I love reading the chat comments they are hilarious!
LDShadowLady,"at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aKEfsVbfg4&amp;t=1m17s"">1:17</a> there was a green , AND SHE PASSES THROUGH IT!"
LDShadowLady,"I always thought of the girl skins as having eyelashes, but I guess they could be seen as eyebrows. It just makes more sense to me for girls to have big eyelashes and boys not to. I&#39;ve never seen a boy skin with eyelashes. Some have slightly darker skin above their eyes, but I just see that as eyelids, like on Joel&#39;s skin."
LDShadowLady,I cant wait for factions&lt;3 AND shadow craft&lt;3 fave things to watch
LDShadowLady,Mousie! Stay S&#39;wonderful!
LDShadowLady,I loved it!
LDShadowLady,I love how those insulting Ldshadowlady in the chat normally are out before her😂
LDShadowLady,Who else seen the chat that said ldshadowlady your baaaaad  and then another was like shut up lol
LDShadowLady,I luv ur vids!! You always brighten my day
LDShadowLady,"That intro though!! Idk why, but I couldn&#39;t stop laughing!! "
LDShadowLady,love it &lt;3.
LDShadowLady,"Did you know, that in one in the chamber, you can pick up arrows, from the floor. So, you won&#39;t need to wait."
LDShadowLady,Did anyone one notice when mousie  typed in chat : no I’m yammy 😂😂
LDShadowLady,Everyone who stole a minecart from LDShadowLady: How dare you!! 😂😂😂
LDShadowLady,Can we just have a moment to appreciate Lizzie and how awesome she is and even thought she is not the biggest youtuber she&#39;s on of the best (.^.)
LDShadowLady,I think the pixel pact should have a special bow on their skin or something special to identify them 
LDShadowLady,"I&#39;m a sub and I&#39;m proud of it!! =3.&quot;I got a fast horse,I got a medium horse,I got a donkey&quot; lol love it"
LDShadowLady,im sick but i still watch lizzie
LDShadowLady,I really want to play minecraft now!!!
LDShadowLady,❤️ the designs 😉
LDShadowLady,I love when u play mini games :)
LDShadowLady,Party!🎤🎶🎁🎂🎈🎊🎉
LDShadowLady,I laughed a lot watching this
LDShadowLady,The intro is just nostalgia
LDShadowLady,listen on colour shuffle lizzie missed 2 darg greens that were close to her............ she had to go for the furthest one x
LDShadowLady,"Lizzie here is a tip for the first game, if you walk and run a little there is for me a 99% chance that you will not fall"
LDShadowLady,"Does the thumbnail make anyone else think I&#39;m singing &quot;I can show you the worrllllld&quot; with Santa??<br>Hope you enjoy, like the video if you do &lt;3"
LDShadowLady,Lizzy: &quot;Does anyone have cows for me to milk???&quot;<br><br>Me: &quot;you have a cow pet..&quot;
LDShadowLady,3 years and 12 days from this episode! &lt;3 I miss these series&#39;s and am so happy for Lizzie&#39;s engagement to Joel! I love you Lizzie! Congrats on your success! I&#39;ve been here since Shadowcraft season 1 and your still one of my favorite you tubers! Keep up the AMAZING work! ily! &lt;3
LDShadowLady,Lol she forgot she had her cow pet 🤣 this is why she’s my favorite YouTuber!
LDShadowLady,did joel ever find all of the heads? it’s been 3 years
LDShadowLady,Its been 4 years and now I&#39;m wondering. Has Joel found all the heads yet?
LDShadowLady,Fun fact: I thought decapitate meant to take someone&#39;s hat. I was at the zoo and a llama took my hat and I was screaming &quot;I&#39;VE BEEN DECAPITATED BY A LLAMA!!&quot; And I bragged about it until I realized what decapitate meant... I&#39;m smart.
LDShadowLady,"Good job on 3M! You brighten up my day! Whenever I am feeling down I watch one of your videos. They always cheer me up! Lots of love, -Allie"
LDShadowLady,"Hmm.. what about making a asnow globe around your house? To me, that would be adorableee! Merry Christmas, Lizzie!"
LDShadowLady,Now that it&#39;s five years I&#39;m still wondering if Joel is still looking for the santa heads
LDShadowLady,"For the milk problem, she could&#39;ve just used her inventory pet cow to fill up the bucket."
LDShadowLady,&quot;We&#39;re going to have to go and tickle some of the cow&#39;s udders.&quot;  -Lizzie 12/11/15
LDShadowLady,She has a cow pet that fills the empty buckets with milk
LDShadowLady,You should put a gate around the pond so the fish does not get out!!
LDShadowLady,"Amazing like always, Lizzie!<br>Never disappoint to impress! c;"
LDShadowLady,You should’ve left a sign to Joel ... “ are you santasfied?”
LDShadowLady,"Lizzie your videos always brighten my day! I hope you see this and I want you to know that you make a difference in the world, not the whole world but my world and lots of others :)"
LDShadowLady,This series is almost as addicting as Laurenzside’s raising youtubers
LDShadowLady,Did anyone else see the chicken eggs? I mean NOW Ollie will know where the chickens are.
LDShadowLady,"One of the best pranks you&#39;ve ever done on me haha! Hilarious, I was so confused xD"
LDShadowLady,"You&#39;re hilarious, Lizzie!  Love this episode!"
LDShadowLady,5 years later and I’ve just noticed that she was on creative mode
LDShadowLady,"Hey Lizzie!! I love you so much, whenever you post a video I just cheer and dance while it is loading. I am always so excited to watch you, thanks for making my life better &lt;3"
LDShadowLady,Who else just loves her intro so much they do it on constant replay?<br>|<br>|<br>V
LDShadowLady,"Congrats on 1.5 million, Lizzie! :D<br>Thumbs up if you think that Lizzie deserves to have more 2 million subs!"
LDShadowLady,😭 I remember anxiously waiting for the next episode and now it’s over 🙁 shaped my childhood though and I still love it ♥️
LDShadowLady,Lizzie put on your Nyan Cat backpack and eat a golden apple. You backpack will play music!<br><br>:D
LDShadowLady,"yk crazy craft series, watching them every spring/summer or during winter holidays.Its became such a tradition now, and never boring to watch them again."
LDShadowLady,Congrats On 1.5 Million Lizzie! Your the <b>best</b> I think you really deserve it and more! :D
LDShadowLady,I’m here 5 years later back to the video that I first saw when I saw 8 years old and I’m still following Lizzie. So amazed at how everything is changed and also still so similar. Wow
LDShadowLady,Lizzie: Santa&#39;s Decapitated heads. EVERYWHERE.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Me: ...well okay then.
LDShadowLady,I want to see their reactions. :) And for some Christmas Ideas maybe a Christmas tree with presents under and then reindeer as well. &lt;3 Put cookies and milk!!
LDShadowLady,Would love to see their reaction to the pranks! :)
LDShadowLady,Who else remembers when this came out❤️Time flies
LDShadowLady,Looking back at old vids! This hurts my heart and warms it too! I wish this was still going on!
LDShadowLady,"Wow, tht intro just made me laugh so hard: &quot;Santa&#39;s decapitated head is everywhere.&quot; XD I LOVE IT"
LDShadowLady,“Cake backpack!”<br>“Ooh cookie!!”
LDShadowLady,The gifts reminded me of when Joe pranked Caspar with the cups of water 😂😂
LDShadowLady,Lizzie makes my day complete!:3
LDShadowLady,This is so nostalgic i watched the series years ago and i remembered it one day and til today the series was so good just like before im so happy
LDShadowLady,Lizzie! Thank you! I love your videos and I just needed to say thank you! Merry Christmas!
LDShadowLady,She said she couldn&#39;t  find milk  but she could  have just use her cow pet hay! Looks like that pet has a purpose after all!
LDShadowLady,”Santa’s decapitated heads everywhere” <br>-Lizzie 11/12/15
LDShadowLady,"You should put milk and cookies inside on Xmas eve, elves hiding around your house, reindeers on the roof and make it look like Santa is chasing after them. &lt;3"
LDShadowLady,I love Crazy Craft so much! you do such a great job of it!!!!
LDShadowLady,"Lizzie, An easier way to get milk is with your cow pet. :P"
LDShadowLady,Yay! I love the crazy craft series! I always get really excited whenever I see an LDShadowLady video in my subscriptions box! :3
LDShadowLady,When Lizzie spent ages trying to find a cow for milk was anyone else shouting on the screen telling her to use the cow pet!
LDShadowLady,Lizzie:Nothing too big (prank)<br><br>5 minutes later<br><br>Lizzie:Santas dicapitated heads everywhere!!!!!
LDShadowLady,Oh and make a HUGE snow globe next to your house?? That would be freaking adorable!! Merry Christmas Lizzie!!
LDShadowLady,High five! Love you Lizzie!
LDShadowLady,I absolutely LOVE your mod showcase ! Please do more ! xo
LDShadowLady,when I&#39;m bored I always find myself coming back to this playlist bc it&#39;s so ridiculously awesome and addictive

GamerGirl,Karina I&#39;m here to congrats u for being nominated for nick I&#39;m so happy😄
GamerGirl,I like how she switched accounts so people wouldn’t crowd her c: <br>Edit: thanks for the likes btw-
GamerGirl,"I’m so happy that this is a long video. So in case I get bored, I can continue watching this. Bcs, I can’t watch 42 minute video if I get up at 6 and have to go to school at 8..."
GamerGirl,Congratulations Karina 💐<br>Your are the best 😍😍
GamerGirl,I love her expressions during the voting time
GamerGirl,I love how karina switch accounts so the others wont follow her
GamerGirl,I haven’t watched you in a while I’m glad I’m back :)
GamerGirl,I like how she just had her water bottle next to her.
GamerGirl,"watching lot of Karina&#39;s Roblox videos, I can see why she decided to play on a different account than her KarinaOMG one. Just because she&#39;s a YouTuber does not mean one can bug her while she&#39;s trying to play whatever game in Roblox."
GamerGirl,"Heyyy love your vids, keep it up and stay safe!! love from Canada 🇨🇦"
GamerGirl,"i literally was playing eviction notice last night, lucky people who got the chance to play with her would be like: &quot;OMG i was playing with Karina and I didnt get to know&quot;"
GamerGirl,I think Karina changed her roblox user so she can play without loads of people bugging her while she&#39;s playing and/or recording the games for people to watch on YouTube later.
GamerGirl,Congrats on kids choice awards!!!
GamerGirl,Hiiiii! I love your videos karina! They always inspire me to create videos like yours on my channel.
GamerGirl,I liked that she changed her name and she won fairly love that about her and I&#39;m waiting for the arcade vid love you Karina and tour vids a toats awesome &lt;3
GamerGirl,i love your videos karina
GamerGirl,I like how she never found out to change her room but she didn’t have any time
GamerGirl,The fact that she made a new acc to just play eviction notice is really awesome
GamerGirl,Your hair is growing back good girl love you Karina watching you since 2018
GamerGirl,Usually ppl  always jump all over her and now no one goes near her lol
GamerGirl,I love your videos.
GamerGirl,You always make me smile 😔😊
GamerGirl,"Omg I love your makeup! And also I’ve noticed there have been a lot of people hating on your haircut, but please don’t listen to them because it does not matter what other people think, it’s what YOU think. All that matters is that your are happy with it and you like it. Personally I love it ❤️"
GamerGirl,Karina ur so beautiful and I love ur makeup and ur stile and I always look forward to ur vids and I always love them I remember watching ur very first video and I fell in love and to this day I am still watching I love u so much❤️❤️❤️
GamerGirl,I like it how she judges the kitchen.
GamerGirl,I’m glad your tiktok account is public again😊
GamerGirl,I loved the almost hour long videos they spare my time :D
GamerGirl,I wonder how those people will feel when they see this video and realize what they did.
GamerGirl,It’s funny when something is wrong or wired you say “it’s chill it’s chill😎”🤣
GamerGirl,She always does her eye liner in her vids and she looks soooo pretty with it on
GamerGirl,KARINA YOU’VE BEEN NOMINATED
GamerGirl,Have a great day everyone!!!!
GamerGirl,"You have to play Outlaster, Karina! It’s a lot like Eviction Notice but you’re in a camp site"
GamerGirl,I&#39;m glad that Karina has a new username
GamerGirl,Who else misses the slime videos on sis Vs bro ? ❤️
GamerGirl,"Notice how in the first round, the first few nominees did not have robux... Could just be a coincidence but I think that its a bit stranger considering that the bacon and the guy who left were nominated  first."
GamerGirl,I was just in a game w someone who laughed when I got evicted but I got back in bc I versed another player who got voted out and won. They said “HAHAHAHAH” when I left. They weren’t laughing now..I won the next game and was gonna vote him. He left cause he didn’t want to face the fact that his team mate was carrying him 😭🤣
GamerGirl,Very nice video karina I enjoyed it
GamerGirl,"Karina did an eviction notice video again, it&#39;s been awhile."
GamerGirl,"before watching this video, i guess yes she will be evicted"
GamerGirl,"OMG, i did not know she was good at singing🎤 im SHOOKED rn🤩🤩 STAN QUEEN"
GamerGirl,lets all agree that Karina and her brother made a lot of our childhoods
GamerGirl,You should continue vloging:)
GamerGirl,I love how she&#39;s a person who don&#39;t skip parts of the video while reacting
GamerGirl,I love how she doesn’t roast herself instead she uses sarcasm to agree with herself 😭
GamerGirl,Good to see you guys back. Missed y&#39;all so much... Me and my sis literally grew up watching you!! I used to check a couple times every month to see if you guys had posted. Made me sad every time I realized you guys quit. I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re posting again. Thanks for making our childhood THAT much more fun
GamerGirl,"the uniform story made my heart drop ☹️ im so so happy shes alright, that’s disgusting and it’s messed up how she had to go through that as a young child ☹️"
GamerGirl,It’s good how her videos are still genuinely interesting to watch and she isn’t all burned out and done with YouTube
GamerGirl,The fact she was talking about the uniform bit was definitely disgusting and disturbing. Because basically wearing your school uniform reveals a lot of your information.
GamerGirl,Karina it’d be cool if you and Ronald react to these videos together!
GamerGirl,She changed herself twice and I’m so glad that the old karina is back and stronger 💗
GamerGirl,"I like how she’s back , and is back to her old self. So fun to watch!"
GamerGirl,"Glad to see that you&#39;re doing alright, Karina! You were my childhood since 2017 and it feels great to see that you&#39;re all grown, I remember watching your old slime and challenge videos, I really miss those days and I just wish I can spend time being young again just once more. But I&#39;m just happy you&#39;re doing better. :) ❤"
GamerGirl,Karina still carrying her childhood fans on her shoulders 💪❤
GamerGirl,It’s nice to have you and Ronald back after a while.
GamerGirl,"Interesting seeing Karina&#39;s reaction to these videos, and how her take differs to Ronald&#39;s."
GamerGirl,who else’s agrees that she looks gorgeous and had a huge glow up
GamerGirl,I know Ronald did this but seeing karina do it is also very great! I’m happy they both reacted to see their reactions 😂❤
GamerGirl,Been so long since I watched you! Lovely to see you grow so much!
GamerGirl,The fact she reacts to those vids no skipping it makes it much better. &lt;3
GamerGirl,i love how she&#39;s not subscribed to the channel she used to tell us to subscribe to
GamerGirl,karina’s maturity and humor is so entertaining omg
GamerGirl,It makes me feel really happy that Ronald and Karina are both growing into their new selves and are growing happier. &lt;33
GamerGirl,"Seeing Karina all grown up and well brings me joy, and happy tears in my eyes."
GamerGirl,"Karina, is there a chance sis vs bro will be coming back? Also I loved your videos it’s weird seeing how much you both have grown now, I got so weirded out once I saw how old you and Ronald had gotten, I’m proud of you both and hope your relationship gets better and you start Making Sis Vs Bro videos again, Make that Comeback! Make all of us go wow!"
GamerGirl,"we missed you, karina! we are happy that you finally posted a youtube video in this channel. can’t wait for more!"
GamerGirl,"I am so happy your doing well Karina, you were my childhood and Im so sorry you couldnt experience yours the way you wanted, ive been watching you since I was 6 back in 2017 and im now currently 12. Welcome back Karina stay strong, brave, confident and healthy!"
GamerGirl,i love how karina looks like shes embarrassed with her old vids and then ronald is like i slayed it all of these vids
GamerGirl,My daughter and i would love watching your videos when she was younger. She&#39;s 10 now and is not so little anymore . I guess I was just reminiscing on those times and wanted to look up those videos. I&#39;m seeing that you&#39;ve also grown up and just wanted to thank you for the good times.
GamerGirl,the amount of coincedence that both karina and roland reacted to the same videos and still had reactions like oppopsite poles like yeah.
GamerGirl,I love how she told something that she doesn&#39;t tell in the past videos lol
GamerGirl,"Im glad to see you ok and healthy after us not getting an update of you. I hope we can see more videos from you i loved the fact you react and tell some stories at the same time too!edit )<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kvoq6b35y8&amp;t=13m37s"">13:37</a>  i just realized the beanie boos too they look so cute"
GamerGirl,I&#39;m not gonna lie Karina you played a huge part in my childhood I would whatch you 24/7 and I now just randomly thought of you.
GamerGirl,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kvoq6b35y8&amp;t=5m05s"">5:05</a> That is disgusting. Glad you’re doing well these days Karina. Keep doing what you want!"
GamerGirl,The way my heart dropped after she said the uniform story 💀
GamerGirl,I love how they both reacted to the sleepover video it’s so fun seeing their both reactions
GamerGirl,The fact that she just randomly complain just makes me smile and laugh 😭
GamerGirl,i love the way she edits her videos or who ever does its so entertaining
GamerGirl,The girls’ sleepover is like heaven. From telling scary stories to playing with plushies.
GamerGirl,Now we need both of them reacting to the old videos
GamerGirl,Good to see Karina uploading again! 🙂
GamerGirl,It’s been so long since I’ve even thought about going to this channel! I honestly wasn’t to interested to take a deep dive to find this channel! This just popped up! I’m so happy I’ve found Katrina’s other channels!
GamerGirl,I miss sis vs bro:( They were my whole childhood but I&#39;m glad you both still post on your accounts and interact with sis vs bro:)
GamerGirl,So happy to see you Karina after a long time 🙂
GamerGirl,"Loved this, was laughing the entire time!"
GamerGirl,"I would love for you both to do a video together. Maybe react together? It doesn’t have to be anything similar to the videos you did before, but I miss seeing you guys together 🙌🙌"
GamerGirl,I&#39;m so happy that this channel is revived I missed these two for so long.
GamerGirl,I love how she got the courage to react these because I cannot stand watching my old eras 😭
GamerGirl,Love how Karina just endlessly roasts herself 😂
GamerGirl,I’m so happy your hair is growing back to looking like our old Karina! :)
GamerGirl,lets take a moment of silence of how much she grown from her first video
GamerGirl,I remember how i used to binge watch your guy&#39;s videos after coming home from school lmao💀lowkey was addicted to them
GamerGirl,I think it would be so cool if y’all recreate some of your old videos! <br>But it’s really up to you and Ronald. 😊
GamerGirl,Hi karina love your  videos BTW say hi to ronald
GamerGirl,Karina a little tip is that if you go to the school then turn on the path on the right it brings you to a full park of orange people and banana people!Also if you go to the spawn and go right and keep going straight you will see a tepee of cotton candy people and watermelon people!!
GamerGirl,"When you throw them out I&#39;m pretty sure you get that money. Like it gives it to you because that was how much the cones were worth, so you get the money that is below."
GamerGirl,Maybe  you  should  go  explore  the  city  more  and  maybe  find  more  flavers.
GamerGirl,hi karina love your videos👋
GamerGirl,"“This is fine, I’m fine, It’s fine.”<br>-Karina 2019"
GamerGirl,I love when Karina plays ice cream simulator 😀😄
GamerGirl,I know that you probably won’t see this but you can sell the watermelon and the blue ones behind the houses beside the pink spiral thingy ❤️❤️

GamerGirl,"go the the banana and apple side near the school. follow the right/back brown pathway. you might see the playground. over there, they have orange buyers. you can go to the gate, go right,  then go straight. you might see a windmill thing. it&#39;s watermelon and bubble  gum side."
GamerGirl,"Karina for the orange, bubblegum and watermelon lolly or ice cream you don&#39;t have to sell it to the other side.  There are the people who want orange bubble gum and watermelon. If you want to know where the place is take a tour around the world. For the bubble gum and the watermelon they are in a place where there is a windmill for the orange there is in the playground. BTW love you Karina"
GamerGirl,"Karina there is a playground, park and also a windmill <br>There are lots of people buying blue orange red etc. Behind the school go and find"
GamerGirl,I really  like this game can you do more?
GamerGirl,I love your vids thank you
GamerGirl,Oh GOD I LOVE THIS
GamerGirl,Thanks for making roblox/minecraft videos that are ok for my kids to watch...have a great day! 😊👍
GamerGirl,if you throw it in the trash you will get that back ❤️ I tried and I did!
GamerGirl,Keep up with the icecream videos because i love them🍦🍨🍧💖
GamerGirl,Karina: And I can say I did not cheat at all I didn&#39;t buy any more money<br>Also Karina: I bought all of this money super easily!
GamerGirl,I ❤️ ur vids
GamerGirl,I literally just got the bike and I found this game by watching your vid yesterday
GamerGirl,"Also it doesn&#39;t cost money to throw things out, it GIVES back the moeny."
GamerGirl,"Just so you know there is a playground where you can sell the orange icecream and there is also a light house where you can sell the blue icecream and both are in the first area, fun video❤️"
GamerGirl,hey karina it&#39;s so easy to buy a van its just 3 days and today I bought a van it so amazing with it!!
GamerGirl,it doesn&#39;t cost to thow things out it tells you how much money you will get by throwing them
GamerGirl,Yasss I love your first video I found this one and I immediately pressed it
GamerGirl,I got a van in the game and it was a lot of work keep doing great
GamerGirl,"will Karina ever realise that the blue, red and orange cones are on the same level? It&#39;s so painful to watch 😩"
GamerGirl,"Karina, there is an area that has many people that want orange and banana : <br>When u get to the area where are the ones who want chocolate go to the “door” <br>then go straight and u will see a playground, it’s there!<br>Or… <br>Go to the School (the place the people that want apple are)<br> then follow the path on the RIGHT and u r gonna see the playground <br><br>Pls give me ❤️ !"
GamerGirl,I love your vids
GamerGirl,Hey Karina you and Ronald should play Roblox adopt me because a huge pet update came out on June   <br>15th. I love your vids btw.
GamerGirl,The one that costs a lot is a train and  a sled.😮😮😮
GamerGirl,I swear if you say raspberry instead of cherry ONE MORE TIME I WILL LITERALLY DIEEEEEE
GamerGirl,l love your videos
GamerGirl,There is apath that leads to a playround the poeple who likes orange popsicles are there<br>There is also a wind mil that leads to blubberies and watermelons but it is pretty far ☺
GamerGirl,"karina if u go to the right of the barn where u sell chocolate ice cream,u can find people who want orange ice cream!"
GamerGirl,At the other side  to the right of the map/world (I think) there is a windmill and there are water melons and blueberry(cones) so you dont have to unlock the new area to sell your blueberry and watermelon cones
GamerGirl,Karina can you play Survivor?a I&#39;d love it if you do! It&#39;s a mix of games that you need to win to 100% stay in the game. AND IMPORTANT TIP: o over to the leader board to play or else you&#39;ll stay in the lobby! I&#39;d love it if you do play Survivor and I subed! U R THE BBBBBEEEEEEEESSSSSSSTTTTTTTT YOUTUBER unlike me :&#39;( .

GamerGirl,hi karina!!!
GamerGirl,Karina the orange people is in the playground and the blueberry and watermelon is at the windmill <br>Btw keep on video
GamerGirl,Karina you are the best love your videos
GamerGirl,I love Karina&#39;s long long videos there it&#39;s just a fun way to pass the time
GamerGirl,I love how positive Karina is<br>You go girl!
GamerGirl,I love how she always says rude when somebody votes her
GamerGirl,i love how when she didnt do anything she goes straight to her innocent voice like when she said &#39;&#39;i didnt&#39;&#39; like she did something
GamerGirl,I still love you Karina you are a Queen you own it!!!  I’ve been watching your videos since I was 4!! I will support you all the way!!
GamerGirl,Wow i wish i could play among us with karina!! :D
GamerGirl,I don&#39;t know why but it&#39;s so funny whenever you play Among Us
GamerGirl,Imagine cyan watching this video and just relize that he was playing with a youtuber lmao
GamerGirl,I love how karina is not embarrassed that she showed her shaved head in public :) shes so brave! c:
GamerGirl,Can you play with you fans Karina? It would be AMAZING your so welcome for the recemondation
GamerGirl,"It is weird seeing karina with a shaved head, but im here for it girl! It is also weird to hear her say, &quot; damn&quot;. She has grown so fast!!😌"
GamerGirl,i love how when karina says she needs hotdog she actually sings the song lmao
GamerGirl,"Can I say that you are beautiful just the way you are, keep going whatever happens cause you are so confident, smart, nice and appreciative for everything."
GamerGirl,It&#39;s nice to see karina because she is brave and she doesn&#39;t listen to what other people say
GamerGirl,its weird seeing karina with a shaved head but u know i love her confidence  U GO GIRL!!!!!!!
GamerGirl,lucky for you karina! when its voting time i say i have medbay or any visual tasks and some people watch me<br>and they know im safe but when its voting time i said i want a buddy but they just vote me off
GamerGirl,Who still can&#39;t get over the fact that Karina shaved her head 😂 but honestly I respect whatever decision she makes weather I like it or not
GamerGirl,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWejLeJ2hmE&amp;t=1m38s"">1:38</a> This is why you&#39;re my favorite youtuber you make amazing content for us every day"
GamerGirl,Is nobody gonna talk about how confident karina is shes such an idol
GamerGirl,"Another video of Karina searching for the perfect Among Us game part whatever. At this person, we all are like, just pic a game already."
GamerGirl,"Karina you slay with the new hair! I love it, you even encouraged me to do it to myself and me and my family love it!"
GamerGirl,"I don’t usually comment but I need to say this. On the last round if I were Karina I would have said “I’m gonna be risky and do a big brain move.” Pink and white were obviously teaming which was clear after the first 3 rounds. When I saw white alone that’s was suspicious, if white is pinks bodyguard shouldn’t he be guarding pink? That is unless pink didn’t need to be guarded… unless she was an IMPOSTER. Also when white said “pink did a med bay scan” that is untrustworthy because as observed pink and white were teaming so white could have easily lied and said pink was safe, and I really don’t think of pink really did do a scan white would have announced that. When you are on a call and team up u really don’t use the chat because you can talk to your partner on call so there would be no need to tell the chat pink was safe, they would just keep that between themselves because they already knew their roles. Anyways I hope people see this"
GamerGirl,Normal people: Picky with fashion.<br><br>Karina: Picky with among us servers.
GamerGirl,I like how she is so picky 😂
GamerGirl,In the video the weirdest part is Karina not realising that she is the host.<br>By the way I loved the thumbnail of today&#39;s video loved Karina&#39;s yellow sis team shirt👍
GamerGirl,I love your videos please keep posting!
GamerGirl,I love Karina’s Among us videos

GamerGirl,Karina basically has her own phrases like<br>&quot;its super duper chill! its whatever&quot;<br>and<br>&quot;look at me I&#39;m a pro!
GamerGirl,"OMG did u see how the closet door was open and then it just closed at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1vNuM_AKWE&amp;t=7m51s"">7:51</a>"

GamerGirl,I was literally closing my eyes the whole time cuz it’s night and I I’m in a paranoid phase where I just get randomly scared 👁👄👁
GamerGirl,I love ur channel!!!!!
GamerGirl,"I feel like the bricks in the pink room AKA Stacy&#39;s room are supposed to be picked up and placed on the outlines of them on the ground of her room, for example..there was a yellow shape..and there was an outline of it that PERFECTLY matched up to its shape..so maybe you are supposed to pick it up and place it on its correct outline. Because I noticed that there were exactly 4 bricks in her room scattered around and exactly 4 shapes outlined on the floor. 😌💅 Maybe instead of picking the shapes up you could DRAG them to their correct shape outline😁"
GamerGirl,"Who saw the closet close at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1vNuM_AKWE&amp;t=7m49s"">7:49</a>"

I have been a reader since I was a young girl and from one &quot;bookworm&quot; to another, nice job Stacyplays!"
stacyplays,i think you should go to a cat island! you would probably like it. there are cats everywhere! also most of them are very friendly!
stacyplays,"I just can&#39;t praise this enough.  This is not YouTube personalities vlogging themselves at breakfast in a trendy cafe.  This is genuinely giving back to this community, and you are AMAZING at it."
stacyplays,That awkward moment you learn more in a YouTube video than you do at school..
stacyplays,I really love this new series

stacyplays,"I wish I could go on actual field trips like this in school, but this is still an interesting way to learn about cool things."
stacyplays,Stacy! I love this series!!! This is so good! You did a great job so far!!!!
stacyplays,I&#39;ve actually been to a wolf an artic fox enclosure and when we got there they were just about to be fed so they got really close to the gate. it was freaking amazing
stacyplays,Stacy this was so cool! I love wolves so much! Question? Will you be interacting with more wolves in the future of this series or is this going to be your only episode on wolves?
stacyplays,"Stacy I am like obsessed with wolves and you just absolutely blowed my mind, this was a wonderfully done and purely awesome video!!! I wish I could award you for a video like this, but for now, take a well deserved like!"
stacyplays,"As someone with a slightly obessive love for wolves, i love that shirt you used on the howling trip."

stacyplays,I don&#39;t think I need school when I have Stacy who can teach us all things in a fun and entertaining way
stacyplays,It&#39;s the second episode and I already love this series and it&#39;s great because we are learning thing and being entertained at the same time <br><br>That never happens
stacyplays,"My uncle lives in Minnesota with his wife, I am so surprised that he has never told us about story&#39;s like this, and I may even move to Minnesota so maybe I could see you stacy"
stacyplays,This will be the best series ever !!! ❤️💙❤️
stacyplays,"Now you have a different story about a dead deer, Stacy. And that eagle was even more ruthless than those guys!"
stacyplays,I&#39;ve been in a cage with wolves. They were wild and could have killed me. Instead I became apart of the Oghran Pack ! :)
stacyplays,A fun way to learn about things.  I wish Stacy was a teacher
stacyplays,"You&#39;ve actually had several visitors to your house. You just weren&#39;t home. The hamburgers were from MythicalSausage. He has a ghast origin. GeminiTay has a blaze origin. So far, they&#39;re the only Nether related ones, but they chose to live in the overworld. Congrats on 10 years. You&#39;ve done a lot of series that I really enjoyed, and your current ones are no exception.  As for the lag issues, I&#39;d blame Scott. Even when he&#39;s not in charge, everything is still his fault. 🤣😂🤣"
stacyplays,"10 years!!! Congratulations! I’ve been watching since the beginning of dog craft and read your books, amazing job on them! I’ve enjoyed all of it and thank you for being an amazing YouTuber!"
stacyplays,i love how stacy hasn&#39;t played minecraft in so long she&#39;s only just now learning about things that have been in vanilla minecraft for years already.
stacyplays,"I can’t wait to see Stacy and Sausage interact! Also <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx0Vzavqux4&amp;t=11m08s"">11:08</a> is such a classic Stacy moment 😂"
stacyplays,"If you ever get another pet, you have to name it Scribe so it would be Ike, Comment, and Scribe. Also, it is Mythical Sausage that left you those burgers, his origin is a Ghast so I would love to see you two go on an adventure in the nether &lt;3"
stacyplays,"Happy 10 years Stace!<br><br>If you want guests, I suggest inviting people from around the server, maybe make a mini game in the nether!"
stacyplays,FYI: your note blocks are playing at the same time because the buttons are signaling both of them. Just separate all of the note blocks away from each other and you’ll be good! Great video stace!
stacyplays,"Glad these comments are open!!! Congratulations on 10 years, Stacy 🎉 You are auch a wonderful face to see making videos again 💙✨"
stacyplays,"I think you should profit from your fire immunity and pick some spawners from nether creatures (you can ask Gem for help, she also is fireproof and knows how to do it) and also pick up some other nether stuff, like the things to grow the various nether plants, etc."
stacyplays,I’m so happy that you’re a part of this series and making content! I’ve been watching for almost 7 years and you’re still my favorite youtuber ❤️ (rewatching old mineclashes still make me laugh out loud to this day!)
stacyplays,Happy ten years Stacy! I’ve been watching your vids since Dog Craft and it’s been amazing to see how far you’ve come! Thank you for continuing to be an inspiration to us all.
stacyplays,Happy ten years! <br><br>I&#39;ve been here since Hexxit days and what a journey it&#39;s been! Thankful for all the content you&#39;ve made for all of us to enjoy and I can&#39;t wait for what&#39;s to come! To ten more! ❤
stacyplays,"I miss crafting dead sm so thank you for nodding the reference w the red wool. Hoping you, Meghan, and Joey reunite on this server &lt;3"
stacyplays,"Oh my god it’s been 10 yearsss!!!!! I’m soo so glad you’ve come back to play minecraft lately I’ve watched you for about nine years? Since the first diversity and then I started watching all your other series and to this day they still bring me joy🫶 I still rewatch diversity, mineclash, and dogcraft to this day they are so comforting. Thank you for being an amazing content creator for 10 years now!!!! We love you Stacy 🫶🫶💕💕"
stacyplays,happy 10 years!! thank you for the wonderful lessons and joy you’ve given us through those years
stacyplays,"Stacy, i wanted to come here and say thank you. Thank you for everything. You basically raised me. You taught me so much. You taught me how to understand and speak English. I grew up with you. I don’t think any combination of the alphabet can never describe or explain how much I love you and appreciate you. Even when hard times came I watched you. Even in my best days I watched you. Even in my saddest dat I watched you. No matter what time or place or mood it was you made my day all brighter. There were so many moments where I was so excited and smiled so much. I don&#39;t think a simple thank you can explain how much I am greatful for this channel or how much I appreciate you for doing this and your dedication all these years. You taught me so much in life.<br>Take care Stacy."
stacyplays,YAYYYYY ITS NEW LIFEE<br>I love this series and I’m excited to see Stacy interact with more people
stacyplays,"Happy 10 years Stacy!<br><br>I found you during mystic mesa, and dog craft I have always enjoyed your content!<br>Thank you for becoming a YouTuber!❤️"
stacyplays,Happy 10 years Stacy!!! It&#39;s so good seeing you on this server! I&#39;ve been enjoying the series so much and I hope you have too! I&#39;ve been watching you for.. 4 maybe 5 years and I&#39;ve loved every second. Congrats Stacy :D
stacyplays,Some intentional lava pits on the over world side could help you  get the way stones with the others help in making nether portals and a small lava pit. I&#39;m sure other new lifers wouldn&#39;t mind setting it up.
stacyplays,"Omg, Stacy! I’ve watched your videos ever since I was 7 and I loved them! As a fellow dog lover, I remember smiling every time you rescued a new dog in Dogcraft and I loved your collabs! I also wouldn’t have learned about carob chip cookies at such a young age if it wasn’t for you! ❤ you, Stacy! 💙🤍💙🤍💙🤍<br><br>Edit: P.S. I also love foxes too! They’re my spirit animal! 🦊"
stacyplays,Stacy I don&#39;t think anyone would blame you if you &quot;tragically died&quot; while on an &quot;excursion to the overworld&quot; and &quot;sadly&quot; lost your current origin.
stacyplays,10 years 😭time goes too fast! Thank you for all of the memories you&#39;ve given to millions of people around the world. It means so much &lt;3
stacyplays,Happy ten years Stacy!!! I love to watch Dogcraft and Mystic Mesa. I also love your book series! :)
stacyplays,Happy 10 years Stacy. Congratulations. You did so well this past decade❤
stacyplays,"The Better Nether biomes add a whole ton of things for you to do to stave off cabin fever. There are new plants that you can make farming areas for, that when harvested produce magma cream, feathers, glowstone dust, black dye, and all the new BN trees. I&#39;m sure the other players would love to come and trade for exotic nether wood types with you."
stacyplays,"Thank you so much for leaving the comments on! I know you cloed them in the past for safety reasons, but this is such a welcome change. I love this series so much!"
stacyplays,"Happy ten years Stacy! Don&#39;t know if you figured this out already, but it was Sausage who brought you the hamburgers!"
stacyplays,"HAPPY 10 YEARS! i’m so grateful to grow up with you, you’ve gotten me through some rough times in childhood! I love your books and have almost all your posters!! Just got the Shelter series because I loved it when you played it, and i’ve been binging your play through for hours! I can’t wait to go back and watch all the other cool games you played like the dogsled series from a little bit ago 😂"
stacyplays,There is something so comforting about knowing my favorite YouTuber was and still is such a sweet person. Happy 10 years to the best!
stacyplays,"Stacy if you need more name ideas for future pets in this series could you name something Bubbles or Daisy? They were my dogs when I was little.<br><br>Glad to see you&#39;re back here on YouTube, Stace!"
stacyplays,"Your gameplays are always so wholesome, thank you for being around"
stacyplays,"Stacy should set up a shop selling a bunch if nether goods, because most origins are too scared to enter the nether! And she can have trades for overworks things that she needs!"
stacyplays,"Happy 10 Years Stacy!! 🎉 I haven&#39;t been here for the whole time on account of my age, but the first time I saw one of your Dogcraft videos I binge watched the whole series and wouldn&#39;t stop talking about it to my family 😂. I hope you&#39;ve been doing well, and I hope you endure many more prosperous years in life ❤❤❤"
stacyplays,Happy 10 years!!! That&#39;s crazy how long it has been since I started watching your channel from your Dogcraft videos and enjoyed the channel since then 🥳
stacyplays,"Happy 10 years, Stacy! One of my oldest memories of watching your channel was when you put potato chips into chocolate milk. Hahaha~"
stacyplays,"Congrats on 10 years! I&#39;ve been watching you for about 8 years but I&#39;ve not watched you for a while I used to watch your UHshes and Christmas Advent challenges all the time! You&#39;re also where I found out what a mesa was lol I remember 5 years ago I was going insane over the Pipsqeak videos and the wrong diagnosis and stuff, I hope he&#39;s doing well and you and all your other pets are too! Also, I love how you still say Page and Molly love you go rescue a dog ♥"
stacyplays,"I can’t believe it’s been 10 years! I’ve been watching you for forever, still love your videos to this day!❤"
stacyplays,Happy 10 years! I&#39;ve been watching since Mystic Mesa and I love you&#39;re content!
stacyplays,"Comment is the best Nether DJ, and Ike is the best dancer. They groove so well, flapping their skeletal wings like that~"
stacyplays,Congrats on 10 years Stacy!
stacyplays,"Happy 10 years, Stace!<br><br><br><br>Your channel is amazing and I’ve watched you for almost 6 or 7 years and even if I’m not watching your channel, your still my favorite YouTuber! Again, happy 10 years! 🐕 🐈"
stacyplays,"Need to get some Blue Ice &amp; Soul Sand/Soil, make a Basalt generator.  Create might have even added other blocks you can make while in the Nether (not sure if Honey is placeable, but Honey instead of water generates Limestone)."
stacyplays,"Im so happy to have stacy back and playing minecraft again, it feels like it been so long 🥹"
stacyplays,Great to see another fantastic episode ❤
stacyplays,Your copper golem is so cute! Clever what you did with the names by the way.
stacyplays,Stacy lovely to hear your voice in such a long time and you are still gaming LOOving it!!I loved your vlogs doing any more ??Summer life in cabin and pets and wildlife???
stacyplays,Happy 10 years!🎉🎉🎉 I love all your series. I&#39;ve been watching since hunger games!
stacyplays,This Nether biome is so cool! You&#39;re a great builder 😊
stacyplays,"i really love that you still upload, i have been watching since i was 7 and now i’m almost 18 and still find your content so funny and cute❤️ i have all your books and i hope you continue to do what you love."
stacyplays,she’s an icon she’s a legend! wouldn’t want any other hunger games partner &lt;3
stacyplays,I’m tearing up a little because of this. You sparked my love of Minecraft and dogs. I wouldn’t have met my closest friends if I hadn’t have joined the Minecraft community. I’m now all grown up and I still remember the very first dog craft video sitting with my old dog (who I recently got a memorial tattoo of). Thank you Stacy. You’ve changed my life for the better.
stacyplays,Seeing the old maps and hearing forgotten iconic catchphrases makes me feel warmth inside but incredibly sad. I hate how human emotions work
stacyplays,I turn 18 in a couple days and seeing this has honestly made me realize how much Stacy has impacted my life. Ngl I shed a little tear when I seen this. Thank you so much Stacy for all that you’ve done and making our childhoods so much better. &lt;3
stacyplays,Both Stacy and Joey screaming “I died” less than a minute into the first games brought back so many memories 😂 Congrats on ten years Stacy!
stacyplays,"I didn’t even know one person could smile for this long. I can’t believe for 10 years I’ve loved one channel as much as Stacy’s. I can honestly say Stacy is the only YouTuber I’ve seen 100% of every video she’s made. Being 30 now, I truly feel like I’ve grown up with her my entire life."
stacyplays,Stacy not realizing that she made everyone’s childhood is insane. I started watching when I was 12 and now I’m in college like literally an icon 😂❤
stacyplays,"Stacy, <br>You’ve inspired a big portion of my life. Watching you from middle school and now as a senior in college I can solemnly say you radiated that positivity to your audience as well. Your advocacy for animals, books, and while still having fun with games it sticks with me so much. I’ve learned so much from you and I really do hope you know how much we love you. Stacy thank you for everything you’ve done and continue to do. ❤️✨"
stacyplays,This made me miss the old days. I started watching you both back in 2013 and I was 12. Now I&#39;m 20 and still watch you both! You and Joey made my childhood the best ❤ Love you both
stacyplays,"Omg I grew up with Stacy, binging Dogcraft and MysticMesa and reading her Wild Rescuers book series and watching her twitch streams AND even meeting her irl!!! Its so great to see another video of Stacy’s iconic, “OH NO IM GUNNA DIE IM DYING HELP”, aaaand with none other than Joey himself! Man! The nostalgia! its amazing to see another video from you again Stacy &lt;333"
stacyplays,"Stacy, I have been here since the beginning. Looking at all those comments of people my age (I will be 19 in june) speaking of how you sparked our love for dogs and minecraft resonated so well! How thankful I am to watch this video and see you glowing after all these years. I will forever love this channel, you, the messages and content you have produced, and your books were a sweet treat! WE LOVE YOU!"
stacyplays,"I&#39;m 16 and I started watching you when I was . . . 8?! I&#39;ve known you half my life! You&#39;ve always inspired me with your passion for big words and books, I can never repay you enough for how you shaped my childhood! Happy 10 years!"
stacyplays,This immediately brought back so many memories and almost started crying when they kept going off each other 😭❤️
stacyplays,I’m so glad Stacy is back! I’ve missed her so much and her videos/ streams 🎉 happy 10 years!
stacyplays,The icons are BACK! Seriously legendary! Watching this back is much fun! Ive been watching both you and Joey on YouTube since the beginning days. I always lived for the two of you! Thank you for this amazing ride. 👏🏻 🎉 Happy 10 Years Stacy! 💙
stacyplays,"Stacy was my childhood. Today I randomly thought to myself &quot;I want to watch Stacy&quot; it just happened that this was the video that she posted. I remember watching her first video as a 9 year old. It&#39;s weird to think that I&#39;m a adult now, but this is one part of my life that I won&#39;t forget. what makes me even happier is that I&#39;m now seeing my nieces and nephews grow up discovering her and the others that I watched when I was their age. To know that they were such a big part of my life, and now its part of theirs, is awesome."
stacyplays,10 years?! Wow. I suddenly feel very old 😂 HG videos were my favourite then and even now they still make me so happy. Joey and Stacy please make more of these classics 😊
stacyplays,"And when the world needed her most, she returned.  🥰🥰"
stacyplays,"When I saw the &quot;10 years!&quot; on the thumbnail, I couldn&#39;t believe it. It still seems like yesterday that I was a 17 year old kid watching your videos all the way back in 2013. I can genuinely say that yours and Joey&#39;s videos changed my whole life. I found The Cube because of y&#39;all, and it led me to friends who I am still close with today. And those friends led me to other friends. And making those friends and finding that community helped build up my self-confidence and led me to continue seeking out new friends, new interests, and new adventures of my own. I wouldn&#39;t be where I am today without y&#39;all. I don&#39;t know what the future holds, but here&#39;s hoping the next 10 years are even better 💚"
stacyplays,I really grew up with Stacy plays seeing this at my grown age now is bringing back all those memories!!! You will always have a place in my heart♥️
stacyplays,This was my life watching these two play. I remember laughing so hard every episode. Thanks for those great memories! I had to edit this message I just finished the video and my face hurts from smiling so much.
stacyplays,"its so wild how I’ve literally grown up with both of you in my life, all throughout highschool and now university and stacy you probably don’t know this but i chose to pursue journalism because of you 🥰 and i not only rescued 3 dogs but a cat too ❤️ u’ve had a massive impact on not just me but everyone that’s watched you over the years i hope you know that xo"
stacyplays,"This is such a surreal sense of nostalgia. It’s honestly really hard to believe it’s been ten years, I still go back and watch old hungercraft and crafting dead videos to relax and fall asleep to sometimes."
stacyplays,The nostalgia! The fact that her and Joey are the reasons I survived my freshman year in college makes this throwback recreation so much better
stacyplays,"Oh Stacyanya, you don&#39;t realize how special this is and how much you&#39;ve made an impact on my life, and so many others. It is impossible to put into words the value you&#39;ve had on my life. Our culture is infested with &quot;influencers&quot; and &quot;youtubers&quot; who churn out thoughtless, and often harmful, content... so for someone like yourself to create content with grace, humility, and wisdom is such a gift. What you&#39;ve done here is much bigger than a single video game. Wherever you go, and whatever your next chapter is, just know you have left an important and valuable legacy on this platform and beyond ❤❤❤❤"
stacyplays,"I watched every single episode of the original series and can’t express how happy I am to have another installment. Stacy you are such a kind, intelligent, and beautiful personal inside and out. Thank you for your humor and joy over all these years❤"
stacyplays,"Almost done uni and Stacy randomly popped into my head and look at this 10 whole years. I still remember how I discovered her through her long dark let&#39;s play and stayed for dog craft. Thanks for all the fun times, happy 10 years!"
stacyplays,"I&#39;ve missed you! You were my childhood. I&#39;m even an adult now, and it&#39;s crazy to think that it&#39;s been 10 years. Thank you Stacy, while I may not watch you anymore, you were someone I looked up too. Thank you for bringing us smiles all these years. &lt;3"
stacyplays,"I&#39;m sitting here trying to come up with a heartfelt comment that truly expresses how much you meant to my childhood but I just can&#39;t. All I can say is thank you so much, seeing this video made me feel happiness I didn&#39;t know I was capable of. You left such an impact on my life I could never thank you enough. Congrats on 10 years Stace. And to everyone reading this, Page and Molly love you, go rescue a dog. &lt;3"
stacyplays,This couldn&#39;t have come at a better time than now. Thank you both for letting me relive one of my most cherished memories in my childhood and for reminding me of the wholesome content that I have been deprived of for so long.
stacyplays,I am 30 years old and this still brings me the most joy. The wholesomeness and love I feel while watching these videos will never be topped. Thank you and congrats on 10 years!!🎉
stacyplays,Wow it’s already been 10 years? I’m so proud how far you’ve come Stacy!
stacyplays,This made feel so incredibly nostalgic to watch. You guys ran my childhood and the hunger craft videos were such a huge part of it. I feel so emotional and happy watching this. It makes me miss being little again.
stacyplays,Happy 10 years Stacy!!! I started watching in 2014 when I was finishing elementary school and now I have one year left of university. You&#39;ve made so many fun and creative series over the years that have brought all of us joy and I just want to say thank you!
stacyplays,"I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 10 years already!  This is such an amazing achievement!  This made me feel like I was 10 again, where life was so much easier, I can&#39;t thank you both enough ❤"
stacyplays,the sense of nostalgia that immediately came running back. thank you for this
stacyplays,"Can’t believe I’ve gotten the privilege to watch something so Important and special in my life come full circle. The hunger games videos literally gave me so much peace and joy as a kid, and to watch them 10 years later as a fully grown adult is so incredible. Thank you for making my entire year with this, you mean so much to so many people ❤"
stacyplays,"Watching this brought tears of joy to my face. I’ve been an avid fan since the beginning, before I had Minecraft myself.  How funny fate is - today I decided to wear my Minecraft hoodie for the first time in literal years, and then I see you’ve uploaded? I feel like I&#39;m back then again. Thank you always; I really needed this today! Happy 10 years~"
stacyplays,The ten years in the title just hit me like a train. I can’t believe I’ve adored Stacy and her channel for that long. Can’t even describe how much this little space on YouTube means to me
stacyplays,Really felt like a blast from the past watching this! 😢Ty Stacy and Joey!!! 💙
stacyplays,I&#39;m so proud and happy to see all of your success — from youtube to your writing to everything in between. To see this 10 year anniversary makes me feel so old but also fills me with so much joy. Congrats!!!
stacyplays,this was a blast from the past! you guys were a big part of my childhood &lt;3
stacyplays,"I will admit, you were my first favorite youtuber, and seeing this video made me nostolgic of my first few years watching Youtube. Thank you Stacy, for everything."
stacyplays,Omg this is wild! SO GLAD I&#39;ve had the chance to grow up with both Stacy and Joey watching these chaotic collabs. Happy TEN Stacy!!
stacyplays,It&#39;s nice to see you again after all this time Stacy. You and Joey kept me entertained since my childhood and I couldn&#39;t ask for a more awesome duo. ❤
stacyplays,THE COMMENTS ARE BACK!!! i have never been more appreciate of a youtuber as i have been of stacy. so thankful for everything you’ve done and all the memories you’ve given us!!
stacyplays,man. 10 years? i can’t explain the happiness this video gave me &lt;3333
stacyplays,Stacy you haven&#39;t realized how much you changed my life. It&#39;s been way to long. I&#39;m 14 and it feels like I was maybe like 8 years old when I was started watching you. Happy 10 years Stacy!! You were such an inspiration to everyone and even me.
stacyplays,"I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve been here so long. I turn 19 tomorrow. I started watching you when I was 10. I loved dogs and I loved foxes and I liked you immediately, and this year I was finally able to rescue a dog &lt;3 (a fox terrier cross, her name is Paprika!) <br><br>Thank you for all the amazing memories. I used to watch the old hungercraft series over and over again, and I&#39;m so glad to see you back together again, even just for one episode."
stacyplays,I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 10 years... So many great memories. Thank you for bring us along the way.
stacyplays,"Thanks everyone for the love on this video! It was filmed back in the fall, but took awhile to perfect. Be sure to share it with your friends and family if you&#39;d like to see more. What other biomes should I visit?"
stacyplays,I love this so much Stacy.<br><br>I&#39;m super happy for you &amp; know you have worked super hard on this series.<br><br>Can&#39;t wait for the next episodes :D
stacyplays,I&#39;m kind of surprised this isn&#39;t a Youtube Red series. It&#39;s very educational and fun! Makes me want to go and explore the world.
stacyplays,Stacy is better at teaching than all of my teachers combined. Why can&#39;t she be my teacher?! Tell me!!!! WHYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!
stacyplays,"OMG this is amazing! I don&#39;t usually comment on videos, but having some background information already on different biomes on our planet, I can say this is a really great video! Anyone with kids could use this as a great educational video, especially if they like video games, and of course, Minecraft! Great job Stacy, and keep up the good work!&lt;3"
stacyplays,"I&#39;m currently in college studying Education so I have to give you mad props for this, Stacy! Your channel is constantly visited by kids and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re using that advantage to teach them about nature in a fun and creative way. Not just kids though, this really sparked up my curiosity as well haha.<br>Thanks for sharing this amazing content with us Stacy! The visuals are stunning and I can tell you&#39;re having as much fun filming as we are watching it.<br>I hope you get to take us to a mesa someday!! XOXO"
stacyplays,"This new series makes me so happy I can&#39;t take it. Stacy travels around, teaching us and looking absolutely gorgeous while being out in the middle of the night, in mines and the forest! HOW?<br><br>Stacy, thanks so much for putting in time and effort for really  good quality videos. I personally think you&#39;re one of the best Youtubers the world currently has! Thanks for being an AMAZING nature teacher! You would be a good English teacher as well!"
stacyplays,Wow this series looks amazing! I can&#39;t wait for this!! The effort you must have put into this is unreal!
stacyplays,I&#39;m so proud of Stacy for broadening her content on this channel. I&#39;ve been an avid watcher of this channel for 2 years and it&#39;s so cool to see her doing something fun and inventive :)
stacyplays,"Stacy, I am going to use this in my son&#39;s homeschooling! Thank you!"
stacyplays,i&#39;m so absolutely impressed!  im speachless at how amazing this series is!
stacyplays,"I&#39;m really looking forward to this series, it&#39;s so interesting all of the things that are being taught and it&#39;s so cool to see the real life equivalence of Minecraft biomes. Good job Stacy! I look forward to the next three episodes."
stacyplays,I love this series Stacy!!! This is one of the most unique and new ideas on all of YouTube. Keep exploring Stacy!!! 😄
stacyplays,Stacy I think what you&#39;re doing is amazing you&#39;re bringing new content to your channel that&#39;s not on YouTube red yay and I&#39;m just really happy that you get to experience and I am learning new things so it&#39;s great and so yeah! Thank you! -Zoe
stacyplays,"This series is not only really cool to watch, but you can also actually learn something! Loving this series!"
stacyplays,If field trips were like this.. I would have paid more attention in school.
stacyplays,Congrats on this series! I was so excited when you released the trailer and it did not disappoint. Keep up the hard work. :)
stacyplays,I love this series:3 not only is it educational but it&#39;s educational in a fun way. Ur combining nature with a video game that has biomes based on real life biomes. This is incredible&lt;3 I bet u had such an amazing adventure filming this&gt;^&lt; I wish I could&#39;ve have the adventure u had lol regardless I think this series is a great idea keep it up💜💜💜
stacyplays,I love all the adventures that Stacy will be going on!
stacyplays,This was so well put together if I had kids this would be the way I&#39;d teach them... just amazing. Cant wait for more
stacyplays,"Absolutely love how you are making learning fun and relatable; not just for kids, but for adults as well! :) As a mom- I respect that!  As a Minecraft player- I enjoy that! Xxoo"
stacyplays,I love this! So fun yet educational at the same time. I never knew that was possible! 💙
stacyplays,"Stacy! Holy crab cakes! I&#39;m so proud of you for creating so many awesome and educational series for you channel. I loved how you&#39;ve branched out from your gaming videos, but still keep the same roots (hehe two tree puns). I love you and I&#39;m so excited for what&#39;s to come :)"
stacyplays,I can&#39;t get over how beautiful Stacy is 💕😍

stacyplays,"I am so proud of you Stacy! This is definitely one of your best work! Living in Hong Kong, it&#39;s very uncommon for me to see snow and tall trees and I am glad I get to see it in here, it&#39;s like I am really going a field trip with you Stace X3<br>The music and camera work is absolutely amazing and I love that I can learn something from those field trip facts XD"
stacyplays,Quite informative! Looking forward to more of this series :]
stacyplays,This is amazing!!! I love this series already! Great work Stacy!!
stacyplays,This is a really cool series! I absolutely love it!! :)
stacyplays,"No wonder this took so long to make, great job Stacy! 😊👍"
stacyplays,"This series is cool! Would you consider doing other biomes, such as the mesa or desert?!"
stacyplays,Why isn&#39;t this on tv?! 😂❤️
stacyplays,This is so fun and cute! Can&#39;t wait to see more :) You should totally come to my home Arizona soon &lt;3 Mesa everywhere :D
stacyplays,"Would love to see more of these videos, very informative. Love them."
stacyplays,This new series is awesome! Love you Stacy! 💙
stacyplays,"Wow! I&#39;ve been here since the start of your channel, I&#39;m so proud of you Stace!"
stacyplays,That&#39;s so cool that you get to explore the real life versions of Minecraft biomes 😀
stacyplays,"Stacys in a plane soaring over the taiga , in the mines, meeting wolves, that&#39;s a lot to cross off on a bucket list"
stacyplays,Great job Stacyplays. Thank you for putting so much time and effort into a series. I hope it pays off and you can continue on this Minecraft &quot;real-life&quot; adventure!! Loved it and I&#39;m an adult!!
stacyplays,"This is so amazing! I have learn&#39;t so many things i didn&#39;t know just from this one episode. Remember to keep making these and keep educating kids like me! Stacy, you&#39;re the best youtuber i have ever come across, so keep making videos and keep being yourself! &lt;3 Love from Kaity ~ xoxo +stacyplays"
stacyplays,I couldn&#39;t stop smiling while watching this. GOOD JOB STACY
stacyplays,Its a really intresting concept. Fun to see how everything turns out :)
stacyplays,"Hey stacy, you might not see this but I just wanted to share a quick message. I want you to know that we all love and support you. You&#39;ve come so far that you even have your own reality series. I&#39;ve seen you grow on your channel and you&#39;ve been strong. I am proud and the proudest I&#39;ll ever be for someone like you. Lots of love for you stacy❤️ -XOXO a big 10 year old fan"
stacyplays,"I&#39;ve been so excited about this! It&#39;s like your very own educational series, like Stampy&#39;s Wonderquest! It&#39;s my dream to one day visit the Boreal Forest, as I love pine and fir trees. I also really like spending time in forests. I suppose it&#39;s rather fitting that my Minecraft skin is a fox. ;D"
stacyplays,"OMG Stacy, I think it was an amazing idea to go around the world and visit different incredible places. 😃 I hope you decide to do more and do you think you might come to Canada to visit a biome? I love you!"
stacyplays,"We don&#39;t need more school, we need more Stacy"
stacyplays,Anybody else jealous of you Uber&#39;s because they get to do this amazing stuff? 💖 Stacy also looked even more beautiful in the sunlight of the forest
stacyplays,This was a really cool video. Keep up the good work Stacy! 😁
stacyplays,"This is so rad! I&#39;m so happy to see that an MC YouTuber is going beyond Minecraft and not just spilling out valueless daily content. So educational and inspirational. Keep it up, Stacy!"
stacyplays,"This is a really well done series! I like the little pop-ups and the way Minecraft scenes are incorporated into the real-life adventures!<br><br>Also, a Mesa biome would be cool! Or maybe a cave!"
stacyplays,I love how everyone Stacy talks to seems extremely happy or even amazed that someone would take such interest in a rather overlooked or forgotten part of their lives
stacyplays,"Such a good series! Well thought out, planned, and produced!! I hope you have the opportunity to shoot many more series! My preference for next season would some sort of wetland like a swamp or a jungle since they have so much life in them and unique blocks!"
stacyplays,This was super interesting. Even the bats:)
stacyplays,"Stacy, you&#39;ve always been one of my favorite youtubers and THIS series only makes me a bigger fan! 1) You&#39;ve taken a game that most of us have loved and explored for years and brought it to us in a context that encourages your viewers to EXPLORE the real life science and inspiration behind it 2) Kids can go out into the world and visit a lot of amazing places that house their favorite blocks and biomes which is exciting and fun for all ages. 3) the series is amazing so far because it&#39;s so original! No other youtubers have seemed to venture outside the game or &quot;Minecraft IRL&quot; bits to teach viewers and expand our knowledge of the game as we know it. LOVE YOU STACY and most of all I love your creativity and innovative approach to Minecraft"
stacyplays,This is already an absolutely amazing series I love these episodes! They&#39;re educational and really fun to watch. Thank you Stacy for being your awesome self and I can&#39;t wait for the next one!! My suggestions for other places to go would be a Mesa (obviously) a snow biome (is it called a tundra?) or a jungle sounds cool too! Don&#39;t forget to ask about ocelots
stacyplays,"My goodness, this is my favourite new series from you, Stacy. :) I know these likely take months of work, but they turned out great! Educational tv shows were my favourite things to watch as a kid, and this series feels like it blends my childhood and young adulthood together. Super cool."
stacyplays,"I&#39;ve been to the Sudan mines as well - but for a completely different reason! There are physics experiments being run down at the bottom of the mine where there is less interference from cosmic rays than there would be at the surface. It was really interesting learning about all of the ways there are for searching for illusive particles :) Loving the series so far Stacy, happy to start it off in my home state :D"
stacyplays,"Stacy, thank you for so much inspiration because once I saw you here, it lets me know that you can learn things just by going places that sound kind-of boring."
stacyplays,I like how Stacy makes you learn because it&#39;s kinda part of Minecraft and we could know what the real life stuff that we may not know! 😀😊So think about that!
stacyplays,"Stacy, I am so inspired by this series, I hope it continues. It makes me happy your happy and having fun. Also teaching your subscribers like me could inspire more and now I know more about wildlife than I ever did before."
stacyplays,That was an incredible learning experience Stacy! I&#39;d love to learn about the jungle or the Mesa!
stacyplays,This mini series was so much fun to watch! It was so interesting and educational. I hope there is more to come!
stacyplays,Stacy I love the direction this series is going in!! Let&#39;s go to ice spikes or flower forest!
stacyplays,"Please in honour of Mermaid Mondays come to Australia to visit the Great Barrier Reef, because it&#39;s the biggest reef in the world and it can be seen from space!"
stacyplays,"I can&#39;t get enough of these,Keep up the fantastic work Stacy! 💙"
stacyplays,I&#39;m obsessed with this series already! I&#39;d love to see a desert episode or two! :D
stacyplays,"I love this so much!! Thank you, Stacy, for bringing so much joy to us potatoflakes!"
stacyplays,AHHH Staci these episodes are amazing! I&#39;m absolutely in LOVE with this new series and super super super excited for more episodes!! This was such an amazing idea and I&#39;m glad you had so much fun making them &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
stacyplays,Stacy brings curiosity back.. we should replace school with this
stacyplays,I really love this series! I hope Stacy keeps making episodes
stacyplays,"I love these videos so much. Not just am I enjoying watching and LEARNING all this, but STACY is also having fun!"
stacyplays,I can&#39;t even express how much I love and enjoy this series
stacyplays,"I loved the trio of videos, Stacy! I think the Mesa Biome would be awesome to see next!"
stacyplays,I&#39;ve been loving this series Stacy! and It looks like you have been too! :) excited for more episodes!
stacyplays,I actually really enjoyed these! You made them so well Stacey and at no point did I get bored and want to click off. <br>For future biomes you should go to maybe some kind of ocean (in summer) and if it&#39;s anytime soon some place where it snows :)
stacyplays,You should totally go to a desert biome! And I love these videos! They&#39;re so informative! :3
stacyplays,This series is so fun! I realize now why it was so hard for you to keep quiet about it but im glad you did. Florian Wetlands or some sort of Ice spike biome would be awesome to see next
stacyplays,This is possibly my favourite series you have ever made! I&#39;d love to see you go to a tundra biome or maybe even a savanna
stacyplays,I can&#39;t get over how awesome this series is
stacyplays,"Stacy, you&#39;re adorable and I&#39;m loving this new series :) I might just have my 6yr old check it out!"
stacyplays,Loving the series! It&#39;s so educational! :)
stacyplays,Just wanted to say Stacy that I used to hate learning stuff like this but now my perspective as changed about learning! Thanks so much Stacy!!😀
stacyplays,"Stacy, you should either go to the Jungle biome or Extreme Hills (Could you come to NZ for one because we need some loaf from more people on the other side of the world, and it would be a nice place to do one as we have many different biomes here - Forest, Extreme Hills/Mountains, Savannah (Kinda), Roofed Forest, and some nice Beaches). Also, I think you should leave the Mesa for last, as it&#39;s your favourite biome and would therefore be a nice ending to this series)"
stacyplays,This is awesome I love it! I would love to see the Mesa. You are so passionate about it I&#39;m sure it would be a great series!
stacyplays,"I would love to just stay home watching these videos, then going to school! This is so much more educational, and isn&#39;t boring!"
stacyplays,Is this anyone else&#39;s fav series???❤️🐺🌲
stacyplays,this is what YouTube ahould be about. This level of content should be the norm of bog youtubers...well done Stacy and seeing you in a desert would be amazing
stacyplays,Stacy you should go to the swampland for your next episodes it would be amazing to see what it looks like in real life please like this comment so stacy can share this idea!
stacyplays,I&#39;ve never seen someone look so good in a hard cap
stacyplays,Amazing series Stacy! ❤️
stacyplays,Is it bad that i have learned more from stacy and game theriosts than in science class and other classes?!?
stacyplays,When&#39;s the next season coming out?! I cannot wait!
stacyplays,Omg Stacy! I love you and this series it&#39;s sooo cool!! My favourite episode so far has been the one with the wolves! You are so lucky!! Can&#39;t wait for more episodes!! :)
stacyplays,"I LOVE THIS NEW SERIES! It&#39;s Stacy teaching us, BUT ITS ABOUT REAL LIFE MINECRAFT! Thank you, goddess! Also you should go to a plains and see horses!"
stacyplays,Stacy you&#39;re videos make my life so happy and you&#39;re love for animals is awesome PLEASE keep being a great insperacion to people  you&#39;re great :D
stacyplays,Yasss! I thought you filmed the next few episodes of this series. You’re on to something with this series! Even if it’s not 100% complete
stacyplays,I would love to see the Mesa in real life... Or the Extreme Hills biome... Ooh and the swamps biome... Maybe the Desert?! That would be cool to see cactus. And possibly the plains biome.
stacyplays,"Stacy, I love this series and it makes my day!"
stacyplays,Stacy being in a big series with lots of people like this just brings back memories. I am so excited for this series!
stacyplays,Stacy having a moment about her life decisions of moving to Journalism instead of sticking to Geology and just becoming an influencer in the end was honestly kind of a mood lol. Life sure is a mystery
stacyplays,"I did not expect the “Page and Molly love you” to hit the nostalgia feels today, thank you Stacy! And I’m so happy to see you back online playing with friends :)"
stacyplays,"Everyone else: I&#39;m going to build a base that will be adaptable to any other lives that I have. Something that retains functionality no matter what. <br><br>Stacy: I am living in the middle of a lava lake with my bone chicken, You all have to visit. <br><br>I was so happy when I saw that she was going to be in this series! I cant wait to see more episodes &lt;3"
stacyplays,Stacy&#39;s nether home looks so cute! It&#39;s like a little nether ranch.
stacyplays,"I was watching someone elses video and saw stacy join and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever felt such pure excitement. I used to be an avid watcher of dogcraft, it was a hugeee comfort for me, along her other popular series! I&#39;m so excited to see what she does in this series &lt;333"
stacyplays,STACY!!!! I&#39;m so excited you&#39;re back to creating Minecraft videos with friends!! I remember watching you back in the dogcraft days. Thank you so much for being a amazing person and loving dogs and animals🐶🐕🐾
stacyplays,"This is my first time watching Stacy&#39;s channel, and I love how this video is edited. The build is amazing, and the pacing of the episode made it very fun to watch.<br><br>I definitely hope that Stacy builds something around the waystone to protect any guests and maybe creates an area of the house that is safer for people who can&#39;t touch lava. 😅<br><br>Geminitay has a spider spawner farm, so there&#39;s a lot of string available once Stacy gets in touch with the other players. They can also get warped fungus by bonemealing warped nylium, so everyone can get themselves a strider friend to explore the nether."
stacyplays,Gosh I could watch Stacy for HOURS and not get bored! The way she story tells and narrates is just so comforting and interesting! Stacy still is in my top 3 favourite Minecrafters of all time! Also your building skills have improved so much Stacy! That house is fireeee 🔥🔥🔥
stacyplays,I’m so happy to see Stacy in a series again! I’m excited to see where she goes from here!
stacyplays,"We missed you, Stacy. There are so many people in the comments saying how much nostalgia “Page and Molly love you, go rescue a dog” brings them, and it’s so true! Your videos have made such a difference for so many people. Thank you! 💙🤍"
stacyplays,"This brings back so many memories! I remember my mom and I used to watch you everyday after school. The Candy isle was always my favorite series, so I’m super excited to see another multiplayer series from you! &lt;3<br><br>Edit: Oddly enough, every time you yell I feel extremely comforted lol"
stacyplays,I still can&#39;t believe I am 28 and Stacy has had her channel for 10 years. I am excited to watch another series on this channel!
stacyplays,"Finally!!!! I have been watching you, Stacy, for YEARS. It&#39;s been so long since you came out with a new series, and it&#39;s wonderful to see you back. I have loved all your videos,  especially Mystic Mesa. I loved it so much that I got your Mystic Wolves Mod pack for myself and I&#39;ve even read all your books. I hope you keep making more content like this!!! Btw you made the term &quot;The floor is lava&quot; very literal. Oh, and you should really name your chicken Lucky, cause you were really lucky to get it on the first shot."
stacyplays,"I am so excited for this series!! Between this and MossQuest, I&#39;m really glad to see Stacy back. And this series already seems like so much fun!"
stacyplays,"I was a big fan of this channel back in the dogcraft days, and I&#39;m so happy to return for new life!"
stacyplays,"Hey Stacy! Small tip for how to deal with the &quot;snowier snow&quot; (powdered snow). You can wear leather boots and it prevents you from sinking into the snowier snow. <br><br>You can also pick it up with a bucket, similar to how you pick up water and lava. And if you just want to break it, you can easily do so with a shovel. <br><br>Hope that helped with your struggle!"
stacyplays,I’m so happy you’re back Stacy. I missed you so much. I have known you for pretty long time it is good to see that you have started a series and I love it so far. I can’t wait what’s ahead in this series. 🥰💙🐺
stacyplays,"She’s on new life, AND WE CAN COMMENT?!?! I’m so hyped and so happy Stacy is back"
stacyplays,"This was really comforting to watch as I watched you every single day after school when I was younger, and afterwards watching Technoblade after school, now that it’s been a year since his passing it’s nice to reflect on these memories positively, and I’m glad to hear everything is going well with you! You’ve probably already recorded part 2 of this but I really like the name Axel for the skele-chicken! (I am 100% recommending my own name and am very biased, but still!)"
stacyplays,I&#39;ve been watching your videos for years but this feels like an entirely new person! I&#39;m loving this video style. It&#39;s cool how you seem to be catering this series towards new or returning people (by mentioning different things about you etc). Excited to see you interact with a slightly different crowd of people to usual!
stacyplays,"The nostalgia is unreal, hearing the gasp and how excited you get seeing mobs! Thank you Stacy 🥺❤️"
stacyplays,The aesthetic of Stacy’s cottage is so adorable
stacyplays,"Having not watched your videos for so long, I can say for sure that I have sorely missed the &#39;Paige and Molly love you, go rescue a dog&#39; outro (plus that iconic gasp lmao). GAH I&#39;M SO EXCITED THAT YOU&#39;RE IN THIS SERIES.<br><br>Looking forward to your interaction with the other members!"
stacyplays,"OMG! Leave it to Stacy to have the most chaotic and clutch narrow escapes in a single episode! 😅 Also, I think a fun name for the chicken would be Carcass! 😂"
stacyplays,"I&#39;ve been waiting for your episode to come, so glad you dodged death like three times because this Strider origin is so unique. Can&#39;t wait for you to have interactions with the other players (like Gem, Scar, Jimmy mostly)!<br><br>Also name suggestions for the skeleton chicken: Hollow, Nito, Sil (for Fossil)"
stacyplays,I’m really excited to see the interactions between you and Gem!!
stacyplays,It&#39;s nice to see you build a base for your character&#39;s unique environmental needs. I like the look of the build.
stacyplays,"Stacy being back in one of these series&#39; just brings so much happiness to me. I&#39;ve missed you, Stacy :)"
stacyplays,"Great to see Stacy back, can&#39;t wait to see where this series goes!"
stacyplays,"AHH I forgot how much I love Stacy&#39;s minecraft content ☺Can&#39;t wait to see where this goes! Also, her calling powdered snow &quot;snowier snow&quot; gives me LIFE! This really made my day."
stacyplays,"I missed Stacy playing in a series with lots of other people, I can&#39;t wait for actual interactions with the others soon. What a gorgeous build and nice implication with the need for lava and anything fiery. The skeleton chicken is so cute you should name him Lucky because he&#39;s your first ever friend and that you were lucky to be able to have him. <br><br>p.s. Leather boots will stop you from falling in the snowier snow btw Stace xD Also might be wrong but I think you can also make armor and tools using amethyst, they need to be fully grown though and big for you to harvest them it works kind of like crops"
stacyplays,This brings back memories! Stacy makes me crack up every couple minutes. I love your content Stacy and am looking forward for this new series.
stacyplays,"Stacy! I&#39;ve been a long time fan since I was 8 💖 So glad to see you again, and I can&#39;t wait to see you interact with the other members! I also think you should name your chicken Ulna. It&#39;s a bone in the wing that helps Birds fly."
stacyplays,"Hearing that outro again gave me warmest feeling! Stacy you were my childhood so to find you again on New life is amazing, can&#39;t wait to see what you get up to &lt;3"
stacyplays,"oh man this brings back nostalgia. stacy was the first youtuber I ever watched and she inspired me to start my own channel (which got me into video editing, which got me into animating, and now that&#39;s my career path... so... thanks stacy!!) <br>anyway, I missed these videos, and I&#39;m really happy to see that the calming energy they give off is still the same as ever :)"
stacyplays,"I have never watched your content before, but have been making a point to watch as many of the New Life creators as I can. I am so glad I watched your video, what a different origin you have! I cannot wait to watch how things continue to play out for you, also sincere kudos for that incredible house build, loved all the fiery accents!"
stacyplays,I miss Stacy’s YouTube series! So happy she’s back to posting on YouTube regularly
stacyplays,I just love Stacy&#39;s reaction when she doesn&#39;t take fall damage while falling into lava. 🤣🤣
stacyplays,I&#39;m so excited to see this series and to see her interactions with the other members also I&#39;m so glad we can comment again at least for this series 🥰
stacyplays,stacy!!! i am so glad u are a part of this series :)) this video made me so happy and excited to see u back at minecraft and i cannot wait for all the fun things u will complete + the fun times with the other members of the server! i&#39;ve literally been watching you since 2013 and so this just feels so nostalgic &lt;3
stacyplays,"Stacy! I think it would be super cute to set aside an area in the overworld to build a camping area, except each tent is a representation on each life you have!"
stacyplays,"can’t wait to see you meghan, lizzie and joey together in an episode it’s gonna be so nostalgic for me 😭"
stacyplays,AH!!!! I&#39;m so excited to see Stacy back in Minecraft with everyone else!! This really bringing back some awesome memories from when she used to play back in the day...
stacyplays,I’m so glad you’re a part of this series!! I think you should name the chicken Shivers &lt;3
stacyplays,It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve watched and I really missed it. I discovered your channel about 8 years ago when I was 7 and have just stayed throughout. You helped me through so many rough patches with your content.
stacyplays,I’ve been wanting Stacy to do a series with more players! I’m so exited to see this!
stacyplays,So happy to see you back Stacy! Hope you’ve been okay. 💓 I’ve been watching you since Dogcraft and still watching!
stacyplays,"Hey Stacy! You should name the chicken &quot;Galiot&quot;. It means &quot;Small Ship&quot;, and since you&#39;re a Strider, and those can be ridden, they can be like a Mini-Strider! Also, Galiot kind of sounds like &quot;Gallus gallus domesticus&quot; AKA the scientific name for a chicken! It could also be spelled &quot;Galliot&quot; to sound more like &quot;Gallus&quot; as well!! &lt;333"
stacyplays,I was finally able to get mods for Minecraft on my computer so I came back to Stacy&#39;s channel to see which mods it was she used for dogcraft and it just so happened to be at the perfect time for me to see she joined New Life. Literally couldn&#39;t have been better.

Niki Nihachu,They did so good! No one has ever beaten minecraft as a bear and a fish...
Niki Nihachu,"she beat the world record, this stream is just extended"
Niki Nihachu,I love how the music Dream uses in his Manhunt videos is just linked to speed running now
Niki Nihachu,The stream ended up being just as chill as it was chaotic.
Niki Nihachu,When someone who barely knows anything about speedrunning becomes a speedrunner and their better than you:

Niki Nihachu,&quot;I died but you did it!!&quot;<br>This is the purest and cutest thing I have ever heard...
Niki Nihachu,I like how she made it 14 minutes long to make it seem like she is as good as dream
Niki Nihachu,Nikki is too wholesome for this world
Niki Nihachu,Tbh she did pretty well nice job
Niki Nihachu,"“We don’t think about possible mistakes, only about successes.” Niki with the sudden deep quotes."
Niki Nihachu,I love it how niki&#39;s chat is so friendly like 0% toxic
Niki Nihachu,“Most of the music I listen to on stream is made by LilyPichu”<br>Woah! I didn’t know Lily made the speed running music!! /j
Niki Nihachu,"She is beauty, she is grace, she is beating bearbubb at her own pace"

Niki Nihachu,hope ur doing well niki !! i love ur videos sm and you make my quarantine better
Niki Nihachu,"Niki should get more roles in the dream smp, she has the talent for it and she would also make a interesting character"
Niki Nihachu,"First Tommy, then ranboo and techno, and now niki, speed running will take us all"
Niki Nihachu,"nobody:<br>cavemen when they find out what fire is: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SXKDj6-qFc&amp;t=6m45s"">6:45</a>"
Niki Nihachu,"Bear voice is like a hybrid of Jack manifold,Wilbur and Ranboob."
Niki Nihachu,Tommy exists<br><br>Minx: I&#39;ve been waiting a long time for this<br><br>Jschlatt exists<br><br>Minx: make it double
Niki Nihachu,I love how calm Minx is with Niki but the second Schlatt joins she gets so furious xD
Niki Nihachu,"The &quot;Best Friends Forever&quot; advancement was from Niki taming Minx&#39;s chat, not Minx taming a wolf."
Niki Nihachu,I love how when jshlatt came on Niki just went quiet and left it to minx to handle with it
Niki Nihachu,The scariest thing that happened to them was a 16 year old saying hello
Niki Nihachu,"Volume wise, I&#39;d say these 2 are exactly like wilbur and Schlatt lol"
Niki Nihachu,Okay but how is this so wholesome and so chaotic at the same time-
Niki Nihachu,&quot;Ever felt being useless? Remember niki has a useless dislike button&quot;
Niki Nihachu,"Man can I just say at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXUsyiiHNgk&amp;t=5m20s"">5:20</a> I still can’t believe there is someone who swears more than Tommy"
Niki Nihachu,Its like watching Wilbur and Jschlatt from another universe
Niki Nihachu,I would love to see Tubbo as a guest
Niki Nihachu,I love how they met over a dating show fighting over wilbur and niki just ended up stealing both minx snd wilburs hearts
Niki Nihachu,as soon as I saw &quot;JustaMinx&quot; in the title I knew i had to turn my volume down
Niki Nihachu,Nikki&#39;s content is a mix between wholesome and anxiety and I love it
Niki Nihachu,TEAMWORK TEAM WORK WOOOOOO
Niki Nihachu,shes so wholesome she dosen&#39;t even have any dislikes just what we needed
Niki Nihachu,basically it&#39;s minx and niki screaming and laughing for 30 minutes
Niki Nihachu,The Chaotic and the kind
Niki Nihachu,I can barely hear over my family talking around me but if I turn my volume up Minx will blow out my ear drops
Niki Nihachu,"Roses are red,<br>violets are blue <br>we all can&#39;t deny that<br><br><br><br>niki is cute"
Niki Nihachu,"It&#39;d be great if she played it with Wilbur, Techno, and Phil."
Niki Nihachu,I don&#39;t think I&#39;m over-exaggerating when I say that this is the best sitcom I&#39;ve ever seen.
Niki Nihachu,honestly the obama skin just adds to minx&#39;s chaotic energy and i love it sm
Niki Nihachu,"Niki is so lucky to have Barak Obama Guard her from skeletons, that&#39;s just a blessing."
Niki Nihachu,A child saying &quot;hullo&quot; was the scariest thing to exist in their eyes...
Niki Nihachu,"&quot;Crying obsidian, is it ok?&quot; My hart couldn&#39;t take it"
Niki Nihachu,"Nikki has the best luck finding diamonds, I can spend hours and fine little to none diamonds"
Niki Nihachu,I&#39;m waiting for techno to join and thank Niki for saying &quot;Techno is my friend&quot;
Niki Nihachu,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXUsyiiHNgk&amp;t=16m52s"">16:52</a> Niki went through so many different emotions at once, its like parkouring through the five stages of realization"
Niki Nihachu,The Chaotic Neutral And the lawful good unite to beat hardcore
Niki Nihachu,Honestly putting a hit on Minx might just be one of the best things I&#39;ve ever done...<br><br><br><br><br><br>...for the content of course...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>...for the content
Niki Nihachu,"So glad I found Nihachu through Wilbur/Dream SMP, I love how wholesome she and Minx are together, and then Minx is a wildling elsewise."
Niki Nihachu,Nikis gonna show that dragon who’s best
Niki Nihachu,I love how minx is so calm with niki its so cute but then boom jschlatt...
Niki Nihachu,Beauty and other Beauty but this one is a flame throwing banshee
Niki Nihachu,Minx seems so much calmer/somewhat wholesome in this ngl
Niki Nihachu,I like how she said to the crying obsidian <br>&quot; why is it crying?  °^°&quot;<br>My heart-
Niki Nihachu,<b>tommy joins</b><br>Minx: you scared the hell outta me<br>Niki: have a good day<br><b>schlatt joins</b><br>Minx: JESUS F*CKING CHRIST GET OUTTA HERE<br>Niki: *just there
Niki Nihachu,When Nikki said &quot;We got diamonds&quot; My mind immediately went to the communist meme 😂
Niki Nihachu,"invite Wilbur and Tommy, to increase the chaos tenfold, and techno if you want to use a steering wheel to beat the enter dragon."
Niki Nihachu,The combination of wholesomeness and utter chaos is truly beautiful.
Niki Nihachu,"im so confused on the relationship Jschaltt and Minx have together. they’re just like buds bantering, right?"
Niki Nihachu,The people that disliked are angry girlfriends that are trying to stop their boyfriends from simping for nihachu
Niki Nihachu,MInx and Nihachu playing hardcore minecraft together??? Couldn&#39;t have asked for a better series!!
Niki Nihachu,When I play minecraft my friend is like I found 8 diamonds im like &quot;oh cool&quot; Niki&#39;s chat &quot;POOOOOOOOOOGGGGGGG&quot;
Niki Nihachu,"I got my wisdom teeth removed a few days ago. It&#39;s a bit painful but I&#39;m managing. But when I started watching this I got all happy and warm feeling. Your joy is contagious and it&#39;s making my recovery better, thank you!"
Niki Nihachu,"Why is this so wholesome tho? They, looking at the piglins being happy for gold and having a pet together was so cute"
Niki Nihachu,the one dislike is jschlatt.<br>edit wtf this got likes
Niki Nihachu,when im sad i just rewatch this video on repeat and suddenly all my problems are just gone because minx and niki are literally there
Niki Nihachu,The 39 dislikes are jschlatts alt accounts cause he&#39;s jealous of nikki
Niki Nihachu,yo that Jojo beatsolos girl was an epic impostor :0
Niki Nihachu,Can we appreciate that niki apologized to her microphone after she bumped into it
Niki Nihachu,Niki:  ooooo with the birthday girl lets go<br>Also Niki: * in a serious tone * ok who do we kill first
Niki Nihachu,People wishing Niki happy birthday and realising it wasnt her birthday:

Niki Nihachu,Lily’s comfi beats playing in the background made me happy
Niki Nihachu,"Niki&#39;s perfect color in the new update would be Coral &lt;3<br>Because she mains red, white, and purple- it would be a similar mix<br>And it also gives respect to her merling role in origin SMP !"

Niki Nihachu,Congrats on 1 mill niki 🥳
Niki Nihachu,Niki and the rest of Red Rabbits absolutely KILLING it in Survival Games was my favorite part of MCC hands down
Niki Nihachu,Can we just talk about how well Niki did even with her setup breaking!! &lt;33
Niki Nihachu,Famous last words said minutes before disaster:<br><b>&quot;Just follow the crowd&quot;</b>  -Tommyinnit in Ace Race
Niki Nihachu,Red Rabbits were such a fun team to watch!! They were all so supportive of eachother and so hype the whole time. This was my first MCC and it was so fun &lt;3
Niki Nihachu,Jokes aside can we agree that Tommy is actually a very competent leader?
Niki Nihachu,why are all 4 of these people so iconic????
Niki Nihachu,Honestly still think this was the winner’s POV. I loved these guys
Niki Nihachu,nikis british accent is getting stronger and honestly i’m here for it 😩
Niki Nihachu,"Didn’t watch MCC, but I know you all killed it girl!!! 🤩✌️ congrats to the winners, as always"
Niki Nihachu,I was routing so hard for red rabbits. <b>I literally wanted to skep off a cliff by the end.</b>
Niki Nihachu,I love how her team help Niki improving herself in this MCC.
Niki Nihachu,RED RABITS WERE AMAIZING&lt;3 best team ever honesly
Niki Nihachu,"even tho you guys technically didn&#39;t win, in our hearts this was the winner&#39;s pov"
Niki Nihachu,Niki you did great in this mcc! So fun to watch!
Niki Nihachu,"a golden team mixed of calmness and chaos, and i’m here for it all. It looks like you had loads of fun and i’m super proud of everyone :)) 💕"
Niki Nihachu,i love how tommy kept saying “keep going niki your doing great” ❤️❤️<br>(edit) WTF I DIDNT THINK PEOPLE WOULD ACTUALLY READ THE COMMENTS
Niki Nihachu,This team was the definition of chaos and I&#39;m absolutely living for it
Niki Nihachu,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LNQQ935O-k&amp;t=7m05s"">7:05</a> Jack being a supportive friend in the chat &lt;3"
Niki Nihachu,this was such a fun pov to watch! i love the red rabbits
Niki Nihachu,although mcc 14 had someee problems and maybe ur wasn’t entirely fair i absolutely loved this stream and the red rabbits pov was amazing!
Niki Nihachu,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LNQQ935O-k&amp;t=3m59s"">3:59</a> tommy has ascended the rules of minecraft and decided to craft legs"
Niki Nihachu,"Jack whispering to niki at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LNQQ935O-k&amp;t=7m05s"">7:05</a> is so cute &lt;3 they’re a perfect duo"
Niki Nihachu,Red rabbits was my favorite team to watch :) they were all so supportive and optimistic.  Even though they didn’t win they were so much fun to watch looked like they were having a lot of fun.
Niki Nihachu,YALL DID SO GOOD
Niki Nihachu,This Mcc was definitely the best one yet and the red rabbits were sooo supportive &lt;3
Niki Nihachu,"Tommy was so supportive the entire stream. I’m not crying you are. Also, if it weren’t for the bugs Red Rabbits would have totally won, but it is what it is."
Niki Nihachu,Last MCC: No facecam cuz very sleepy.<br>This MCC: No facecam cuz it broken.
Niki Nihachu,THIS WAS SUCH A SOLID TEAM!! gg guys
Niki Nihachu,I felt bad for her during this one she was getting stressed
Niki Nihachu,This team up makes me so happy I love how they’re all so supportive and happy to play with each other :D
Niki Nihachu,"i was watching the stream and in the beginning niki&#39;s face cam broke so she was really stressed YET SHE STILL PLAYED SO WELL AND STAYED POSITIVE, AN ABSOLUTE LEGEND 💓🐰"
Niki Nihachu,"This team was amazing!!! A combination of all my favorite mcyts, PogChamp!! (:"
Niki Nihachu,"You did a great job Niki!! I&#39;m proud of you&lt;3 Your mates did it very well, too&lt;3"
Niki Nihachu,Yay I was so happy when you were live on mcc and your skin was amazing 🤩
Niki Nihachu,"Yooo, you guys did great! U were in 1st most of the time, and I’m sure it was tons of fun! You guys were very cooperative and Tommy killed it in a certain game, I forgot which one though"
Niki Nihachu,LMAO I LOVE THE SOUND EFFECT FOR ACE RACE ITS VERY ACCURATE
Niki Nihachu,"4 iconic humans with britisher accents playing mcc, seems legit"
Niki Nihachu,Tommy being supportive and nice for once is so wholesome :)
Niki Nihachu,this was such a winners pov they got so robbed in ace race :((
Niki Nihachu,The teamwork for this team was amazing
Niki Nihachu,This was one of the funnest mcc’s to watch! Your guy’s team had such a great dynamic and I just loved all of the teamwork!
Niki Nihachu,"That was close, you all did so good!!<br>The best POV in MCC for me , it was so excited &lt;3"
Niki Nihachu,"red rabbits is the best POV and it will always be the winner of this MCC for me &lt;3 everyone in this team is just really fun and supportive of each other even in the times where they were getting stressed<br><br>even though it&#39;s been a week after the championship, huge congratulations again!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3"
Niki Nihachu,the four of them are just such an iconic team I can&#39;t
Niki Nihachu,MORE NIKI CONTENT IS ALWAYS APPRECIATED LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Niki Nihachu,lets go bread with the editing 👏👏
Niki Nihachu,"The whole red rabbits team and their team dynamic was amazing but Tommy’s 6 kills on sky battle and Niki’s survival games round, and Tubbo’s ace in battle box were so good"
Niki Nihachu,when Tommy said &quot;follow the crowd&quot; at the beginning of Ace Race after knowing what happened I felt the foreshadowing...
Niki Nihachu,can we appreciate how much niki has improved in mcc??? SHES AWESOME
Niki Nihachu,i love how niki&#39;s community is generally considered very chill and welcoming and then you have all the pet murderers
Niki Nihachu,"I love how Tommy makes fun of Niki&#39;s brother for eating wood, but then we find out like two minutes later that he will eat literally anything. Remotes, pens, you name it."
Niki Nihachu,"Niki&#39;s chat: <b>supportive, encouraging, all-around chill</b><br>Niki&#39;s chat&#39;s confessions: <b>&quot;I killed my fish&quot;</b>"
Niki Nihachu,"Niki&#39;s Chat, normally: chill vibes, kind, nice to be around :D<br>Niki&#39;s Chat, in confessions: <b>pet murderers</b><br><br>Love the duality lol"
Niki Nihachu,"Tommy&#39;s the kind of guy to see a wasp and say, &quot;is anyone going to smash that?&quot;, And not wait for an answer."
Niki Nihachu,The start of the 1D story I was like “haha that’s a whole mood” and then they said that they matched with him on a dating website and I went “HOLD UP-“ and then they said that he’s now dating their brother and I said “WHAT IN THE WATTPAD SHIT IS THIS”… that story was a whole roller coaster of emotions 😭
Niki Nihachu,"I love when Niki and Tom do something together, especially reading confessions! They just have that perfect energy. Honestly hoping for a part 3. Niki and Tommy are literally like siblings."
Niki Nihachu,Some of these are awfully disturbing... and I&#39;m not suprised at all.
Niki Nihachu,Niki&#39;s brother is the kind of person to see a bed and ask &quot;is anyone going to eat that?&quot;<br>and not wait for an answer.
Niki Nihachu,EVERYONE NEEDS A PART THREE THIS IS TOO GOOD
Niki Nihachu,niki and tommy have perfect sibling energy
Niki Nihachu,"I love all the confessions videos so much , they are hilarious, I will now always think of wasps as  jack manifold of the bee industry🤣"
Niki Nihachu,Yes! More confessions! 😌 These are always so funny. 😂 Thank you niki for reading these things. They are so funny.
Niki Nihachu,This duo is really entertaining and then the completly absurd stories
Niki Nihachu,I love their dynamic so much (on both of them separately). It was such a fun stream and it is such a fun video. Thank you&lt;3
Niki Nihachu,"i always love niki and tommy content but this is my FAVORITE video of them ever it was hilarious and felt like i was just watching them hang out, best dynamic you guys should make more videos together"
Niki Nihachu,When niki uploads I always know it&#39;s a good video
Niki Nihachu,IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED. TOMMY IS THE TYPE OF GUY TO SAY IS ANYONE GONNA EAT THAT AND NOT WAIT FOR AN ANSWER
Niki Nihachu,Love this duo so chaotic yet calm all together
Niki Nihachu,I actually also chew on a lot of things. Nails are usually the main victims<br>Found out a couple years ago that it&#39;s actually a stim (I&#39;m autistic) and bought some chew necklaces<br>I still bite my nails or pens occasionally but it&#39;s definitely helped to have a necklace. The texture of the one I&#39;m currently using is also very pleasing :D
Niki Nihachu,this is a series we all needed that we didn’t know we need
Niki Nihachu,nikis voice is literally so calming omg
Niki Nihachu,"I have a confession that I’m gonna say because I know no one will see it in the 497 comments. <br><br><br><br><br>In kindergarten, We where going to the arrows to line up. We where outside near the playground, and all of kindergarten was out there talking my ears off. The principle was calling our classroom numbers to tell us to go inside, and I couldn’t hear anything because of how much talking there was. So 5 year old me decided to scream at the top of my lungs ‘I can’t hear’. Everyone stopped talking, including the principle. Every person there was staring at me, no one was talking at all. Then I apologized and went to the front of the crowd of germ monsters and apologized, then continued to be stared at by everyone as the principle kept calling numbers. <br><br>Edit: This may seem little or not as big of a deal to some people, but I’ve always struggled with social problems so this will always be remembered"
Niki Nihachu,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HrFuki1sAw&amp;t=9m43s"">9:43</a> tommy is the kind of guy that sees a TV remote and asks &quot;is anyone gonna eat that?&quot; And not wait for an answer"
Niki Nihachu,I need to hear more about the 1D story with the teacher. I&#39;m officially invested in this person&#39;s life
Niki Nihachu,"I love how about 20% of this video is confessions, and the other 80% is purely Tommy having ADHD."
Niki Nihachu,I love this duo so much ❤
Niki Nihachu,My day is always better when niki posts ❤
Niki Nihachu,"Tommy is just like me, I chew on everything."
Niki Nihachu,Tommy is totally the neighbours&#39; kid
Niki Nihachu,"if tommy knew that chewable stim toys existed, i have a feeling he would just morph into a golden retriever and never return. mans would have the time of his life gnawing on every stim toy ever"
Niki Nihachu,Tommy is the king of guy to ask “is anyone gonna chew that?” And not wait for an answer.
Niki Nihachu,“I murdured my own fish” thats the most random confession lmao
Niki Nihachu,Tommy stating that after being rejected by a girl he is going to bang her brother is priceless.
Niki Nihachu,niki: <b>tells story about brother</b> me: wait…if her brother ate wood..did he even choke 😅😅
Niki Nihachu,Here&#39;s my confession. <br><br>When I was 4 I tried dog food with my sister. We liked it
Niki Nihachu,We need more Tommy!
Niki Nihachu,Sounds like Niki&#39;s brother was just trying to cook the wood before he ate it. Perfectly reasonable if you ask me
Niki Nihachu,that last confession has me absolutely dying what the hell was that
Niki Nihachu,Im not sure if she reads olds comments but she does a great job making content for people to watch just wanted to say that for the record and good job 👍
Niki Nihachu,Nikis brother literally sounds like cats brother from victorious and the fact she says the strange stuff he does so innocently
Niki Nihachu,"confession for the yt community:<br>i once had a fish named flash which they gave me from kindergaten and i had it to third grade, so at third grade i had a lot of trouble feeding it cause i have adhd and i had killed 100 fish by giving too much food but this one was different. so i gave flash his food and i rarely feeded him cause when i tried to my mind just goes nope and i dont so he starved to death and i cried after him not knowing why? i was the one who murdered all the fish and i was so sad cause i had bird which i loved and bcz of my parents he died and my cat got sick and my parents didnt even ask me and sent her to the woods and now my fish was gone"
Niki Nihachu,these uploads literally make my day even tho i already know the streams it just makes me happy
Niki Nihachu,Imagine just seeing a Tom Simons vlog titled “Stuffing Tubbo into a washing machine”…<br><br>I would be scared lol
Niki Nihachu,That last one was so out of pocket and had me in stitches! XD
Niki Nihachu,"When my friend was a toddler she also had a fish, one day her parents told her to clean the fish and she took it literally and gave him a bubble bath and scrubbed him, effectively killing it. She cried for three days 🤣"
Niki Nihachu,I have a confession too. One time a peed myself in primary school (I was about 5) and I left it there then went to class. Only my friend saw and so I told her not to tell anyone and she agreed. We got in class and the teacher said to the class that someone had peed and a boy from the other class slipped in it . I looked at my friend and gave her the “don’t tell on me” look but she raised her hand anyway and said to the whole class that it was me . The teacher sent the whole class out and asked me why I did it as if I had just murdered someone. I told her I couldn’t make it the the bathroom in time and she said ok and sent me to the office to get cleaned up but really I just peed on the ground cos I couldn’t be bothered to go to the bathrooms . I think most people who were in that class have forgotten about it but I will always remember lol 😂
Niki Nihachu,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HrFuki1sAw&amp;t=2m04s"">2:04</a> just imagined a horrifying scenario where u accidentally kill a plush/toy and the other toys look in horror as you play with their corpse"
Niki Nihachu,"Speaking of wasps, I remember when I was three I would follow a wasp around with a rock. As soon as it would land, I would gently set the rock on it. Then I would grab another rock and do the same thing. A couple days later my dad mowed the lawn and half the lawn was covered in dead wasps."
Niki Nihachu,"Um… one story I like to share is when I was about 1 year old, my brother was about 3 weeks, and mom left us alone. She went to put a box away, and when she came back, I had shoved cat food down my brothers throat and was laughing my butt off. I continued to shove another hand-full of cat food in his mouth while he choked. I thought it was very funny. My brother, however, did not. But yeah, my thing back then was when I tried to feed my brother, I’d shove the nose in his mouth wether he liked it or not. I was not very sympathetic 😂"
Niki Nihachu,Niki can literally be anyone’s best friend-
Niki Nihachu,"“Shut your face, Niki.”<br>“SHIT MY FACE?!?!”<br>“Yeah, shut your face. That’s what I said.”<br>Niki’s understanding is wonderful."
Niki Nihachu,Ori&quot;s voice is like that one anime character that is mysteriously adorable
Niki Nihachu,"Im a simple woman. When Niki posts, I click"
Niki Nihachu,Niki&#39;s titles these days are so poetic
Niki Nihachu,And it turns out that the 1 brain cell that they&#39;re talking about is the 1 brain cell that we all share over the internet
Niki Nihachu,This title accurately described my current cognitive position
Niki Nihachu,Niki and Ori are that one dynamic duo you never knew you needed.
Niki Nihachu,Ori sounds like a dad that is trying to get his daughter to behave
Niki Nihachu,"Don&#39;t worry Nikki, quarantine has brought everyone down to 1 brain cell."
Niki Nihachu,Niki literally becomes friends with like everyone she meets
Niki Nihachu,they were trying to murder each other the whole time HAHHA
Niki Nihachu,i think everyone on the internet is sharing this single braincell rn
Niki Nihachu,Niki&#39;s really been popping off on youtube recently!! I&#39;m really enjoying the content she&#39;s putting out!! :D
Niki Nihachu,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aumeJ_2vV_0&amp;t=13m03s"">13:03</a> the way Ori&#39;s character just taps his foot as he says &quot;i cant believe you&#39;ve done this!&quot;"
Niki Nihachu,Me: <b>Doin important things that can impact my future</b><br>Niki: <b>Uploads</b><br>Me: <b>Jumps up and down cause of excitement</b>
Niki Nihachu,niki has absolutely cracked the video title game ever since &quot;am fish&quot;
Niki Nihachu,“say something if you don’t want me to kill you”<br>ori:
Niki Nihachu,Niki : How do I punch (5 seconds later) Niki : did I kill you!?
Niki Nihachu,This is just wholesome betrayal
Niki Nihachu,Ori and Niki’s friendship is supreme
Niki Nihachu,Why do the cats or whatever they are look like Fundy O-o
Niki Nihachu,Oh my god I haven’t seen BattleBlock Theater in so long this is epic
Niki Nihachu,That title is how everyone feels when they start exams
Niki Nihachu,Haven&#39;t seen people play this game in YEARS. This game was amazing and a blast to play with friends. Thanks for playing it!
Niki Nihachu,"Ori: &quot;Let me help you, Niki.&quot;<br>Also Ori: <b>Betrayal</b>"
Niki Nihachu,"Niki is just so wholesome and sweet, why don&#39;t I have people like her in my life 😔"
Niki Nihachu,THEY R LIKE OPPOSITES I LOVE THEIR FREINDSHIP SO MUCH
Niki Nihachu,Niki: I wanna punch you! <br>Ori: WHAT?! <br>👁️👄👁️
Niki Nihachu,Oml it’s Niki and Ori again. Must prepare for cuteness.
Niki Nihachu,Niki doesnt realize but she is making our quarantine&#39;s way better
Niki Nihachu,The dynamic duo..😍😍🤗
Niki Nihachu,Words can’t describe how much I loved battleblock theatre when I was younger.
Niki Nihachu,The dislikes are so mesmerized of Niki&#39;s beauty that they forgot which one is the like button
Niki Nihachu,"one brain cell is shared between these two, and I love it"
Niki Nihachu,I&#39;m here after she changed the title from &#39;Only 1 braincell&#39; to &#39;Battleblock theater is hilarious&#39;
Niki Nihachu,Me seeing the title:<br>Also me: thinks the thumbnail is Fundy
Niki Nihachu,I love the dynamic of Niki and Ori together. Its mildly chaotic but their voices sound so soothing
Niki Nihachu,this is such a wholesome duo I love it
Niki Nihachu,The Niki and Ori duo is actually really pog 👌🏻
Niki Nihachu,The amount of excitement Niki had when she realised she could touch the water is the amount of excitement I have when I see any food whatsoever
Niki Nihachu,The wholesome duo we didnt know we needed
Niki Nihachu,This is the epitome of staying up at 3AM and playing video games
Niki Nihachu,I can’t get over the fact that Niki can be anyone’s friend she is so nice no matter what
Niki Nihachu,Holy shit I haven’t seen this game for years. this was one of my favorite on the Xbox 360. I remember when I would go over to my friends how and we would replay all the levels for hours
Niki Nihachu,One brain cell is already a lot.
Niki Nihachu,She got some cool and interesting content on her videos.
Niki Nihachu,The enemies look kinda like fundy
Niki Nihachu,We will miss the previous title:<br>“There is a single braincell” or something along those lines
Niki Nihachu,Ori and Nikis collabs are my new favorite thing on YouTube.
Niki Nihachu,Minx: Do you want a turn with the stripper <br><br>Niki: I&#39;ve never even been to a club and no not the stripper <br><br>Also Niki: <b>Horrified and running from stripper</b>
Niki Nihachu,This was literally one of the strangest things I’ve ever watched but at the same time absolutely amazing
Niki Nihachu,Minx’s mental breakdown about marriage was too real and relatable it triggered my fight or flight.
Niki Nihachu,love how niki - regarded as one of the most wholesome people on the internet - just kills everyone at the end
Niki Nihachu,niki’s and minx’s relationship is so precious
Niki Nihachu,"This was such a fun mess to watch, lol.  I feel like the running theme with Minx and anything involving relationships is just &quot;I have NO idea what&#39;s happening, but I&#39;m pretty sure I like it here anyway.&quot; and this is no exception.<br>I really hope a lot of you ladies do more stuff together in the future, you&#39;re all very entertaining!"
Niki Nihachu,if minx got married irl the reception party will be amazing
Niki Nihachu,Alt title: I go to a Bachelorette party and  kill everyone on accident<br><br>Next video: I go to a wedding and a Pig King kills everyone on purpose.
Niki Nihachu,"548 likes, 0 dislikes, perfectly balanced, as all things should be."
Niki Nihachu,"Imagine having friends, could not be me."
Niki Nihachu,if u listen clearly niki&#39;s voice would make a perfect fit for star fires voice.
Niki Nihachu,Love to see technoblade got a second job
Niki Nihachu,"it&#39;ll be fun, they said."
Niki Nihachu,This is the closest Ill ever get to a bachelorette party
Niki Nihachu,In minx wedding:<br>Wilbur to Niki: What is that dress!?
Niki Nihachu,This was such a good stream &lt;3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Yes I went to the stream and I watched this
Niki Nihachu,Expect the unexpected with Minx
Niki Nihachu,Me: <b>Sees Niki has posted a new video</b><br>Me: Niki Pog
Niki Nihachu,"You should teach us the languages you know, it would be awesome ♥️"
Niki Nihachu,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yxg30D1sK4&amp;t=7m01s"">7:01</a><br>“She’s not even Irish?”<br>Lol this bunch is hilarious"
Niki Nihachu,I like how in the description Slick is on their own line...<br><br>Also I remember watching this stream and just being terrified someone would come in and see me watching it lol
Niki Nihachu,This was such a fun stream :D
Niki Nihachu,&quot;It would be fun they said&quot;<br><br>I see you also got scammed
Niki Nihachu,niki and minx friendship is the definition of bruh and hiii &lt;3 girls
Niki Nihachu,we love you Niki keep it up &lt;3
Niki Nihachu,I love how Niki is guard of everyone there
Niki Nihachu,this was so chaotic but in the best way x

Niki Nihachu,No one :<br>Only niki : i have fun of marrying girlfriend minx
Niki Nihachu,niki is actually adorable🥺
Niki Nihachu,"Niki ich sehe dich jetzt schon seit Monaten auf YT, ohne dich aktiv zu verfolgen. Du scheinst im englischen Raum sehr gute Verbindungen zu haben, aber kaum etwas mit deutschen Youtubern zu machen. <br><br>Dein Kanal wirkt auch noch (Auch wenn die Zahlen bereits sehr respeltabel sind) sehr klein für eine so gut verbundene YT/Streamerin.<br><br>Ich denke du würdest auf jeden Fall mehr Reichweite bekommen, wenn diese Verbindungen weiter nutzt und mit offline TV mehr machst.<br><br>Ich bin sehr begeistert von deiner Person und du kannst sicherlich mehr aus dir machen. ^^<br><br>Es wäre echt cool mal mit dir zsm. Minecraft zu spielen. Und das denke ich nicht nur für mich selbst, sondern auch in übertragenem Sinne auf die anderen YT/Stremer, die die gleichen Spiele wie du spielen. :^)"
Niki Nihachu,I was laughing so hard while watching the stream I’ve never laughed sm with a stream before 😭😭
Niki Nihachu,*chaotic screaming *<br>Niki : I went to a bachelorette party and killed everyone <br><br><b>soft cute outro music plays</b>

Youtuber,Comments
Dexbonus,Sometimes I wish I could see the chat and their reactions to certain stuff on screen
Dexbonus,"I love your style! Just found your channel the other day and no matter what video i clicked on, you always wore something i loved xD love your channel!"
Dexbonus,Those closing to this video is killing me. XD
Dexbonus,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX9cGvNu_GM&amp;t=00h00m17s"">00:00:17</a> she’s on screen<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX9cGvNu_GM&amp;t=01h42m36s"">01:42:36</a> she’s back<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX9cGvNu_GM&amp;t=01h49m08s"">01:49:08</a> the puzzle starts<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX9cGvNu_GM&amp;t=02h29m14s"">02:29:14</a> the puzzle is done.

Dexbonus,"My large measuring-cups from ikea has both deciliter and cup-scales at the side. I use my phone to convert measurements as I bake, really easy."
Dexbonus,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX9cGvNu_GM&amp;t=51m28s"">51:28</a> I am one of those who avoids kids like the plague if i can help it. I dont want any for the foreseeable future XD Though im in my mid-20s ...maybe by mid to late 30s ill change my mind. Even then itd be foster or adopt... a lot of kids need help out there"
Dexbonus,Why are people shaving a line in their eyebrows
Dexbonus,Mommy 😍
Dexbonus,"Hi dodger :),"
Dexbonus,Miss u
Dexbonus,ello
Dexbonus,Alo
Dexbonus,"Guys, in case people missed it: this is a supergiant game - from the guys who made bastion, transistor and pyre - all phenomenal games: also one of TBs favourite studios I recall."
Dexbonus,"I like the fact that even though it&#39;s a rogue-lite, it has a solid story and characters. Most of these types of games barely bother."
Dexbonus,Dionysus was actually an OP god of chaos before he got demoted to partyboi. Check out Overly Sarcastic&#39;s episode on him!
Dexbonus,Seeing where Dodger started after how godlike she is at this nowadays is kinda surreal 🤣 also wow Tartarus got a serious facelift
Dexbonus,"I bought it, the day it came out on steam and damn its a lot of fun and I really like the greek mythology so its a win win for me."
Dexbonus,A&#39;ight. Time to catch up on... oh lawd... 100+ hours of this (so far)? Alrighty!
Dexbonus,"The Greek Gods do mainly suck.<br>Except for Hestia. She was the only one who never did nothing wrong to nobody. Goddess of Home,Hearth, the flame, and Peace I believe. <br><br>So in conclusion, Hestia is still bestia."
Dexbonus,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18C-PdvEGs4&amp;t=2h14m00s"">2:14:00</a> dodger asking the real questions"
Dexbonus,"as That Person Who Never Grew Out of The Mythology Phase, love this game! Too bad I suck majorly and rogue-lites."
Dexbonus,The main character looks like a fusion Dante and Donte if he stole Kratos&#39; wardrobe when he traveled to China.
Dexbonus,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18C-PdvEGs4&amp;t=20m15s"">20:15</a> to be honest at first I throught it’s the voice actor that did alucard voice in Netflix castlevania. It’s not him after looking up but he sounds almost just like him."
Dexbonus,when she snips at the computer is when i pressed the like button
Dexbonus,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18C-PdvEGs4&amp;t=2h50m55s"">2:50:55</a> (placeholder)"
Dexbonus,<i>time to catch up!</i>
Dexbonus,Looks a little like Diablo.
Dexbonus,MY EARS. why does she scream like that when she loses ? not even a banshee screams like that
Dexbonus,"Not only does Dodger have a really fun, silly personality, but she&#39;s also an extremely intelligent and insightful thinker.  This is why I am a fan of hers."
Dexbonus,thank you!!! ;___; That makes me feel awesome I really appreciate it. When I was in Ukraine a guy I met was technically fluent in Ukrainian but a lot of people still couldn&#39;t understand him because his accent was so muddy. I think that was when I realized how important it is to work hard at pronunciation as well as just knowing the words &lt;3
Dexbonus,Amazing how dodger can take the time to cheer us up. even while sick in bed. 
Dexbonus,It all makes sense now why dodger is so naturally beautiful even while sick she looks gorgeous
Dexbonus,I hope she recovers her original pitch while speaking french one day :3
Dexbonus,I hope you feel better soon Dodger.  I&#39;ve also been sick so I really sympathize *hugs*
Dexbonus,"Feel better, Dodger. Don&#39;t let this stomach thing get you down, bra"
Dexbonus,"20:55 So true. Thank you Dodger. But honestly, your expression at 14:45 was just so awesome. And the long scene of thinking what you were going to say. Golden."
Dexbonus,Thank you for making my day better once again Dodger!! enjoy your time in France!!
Dexbonus,Dayyym you look good even when you&#39;re sick :) Get well soon Dodger
Dexbonus,"I love how you speak in a slightly higher pitch when you speak french, it&#39;s adorable :)"
Dexbonus,"I hope you get better soon Dodger :( Nothing sucks more than going on a trip and then getting sick mid trip.
"
Dexbonus,"Interesting to hear you&#39;re point of view Dodger! French is a complex and beautiful language  to master. A point of pride, that the French feel the need to protect! As for leftovers, most restaurants will find it strange for you to ask for a doggy bag, it&#39;s just not done. Also believe it or not but, eating out in France isn&#39;t as commonly done as in the US. It is considered a special treat! So a proper restaurant experience is important to us frenchies!"
Dexbonus,"Bon courage Dodger, j&#39;espère que vous senserez mieux plutôt!"
Dexbonus,"Even though you&#39;re sick you looks really pretty in this, Dodger! Your hair looks fantastic!
Hope you feel better soon, I know how it feels.. I also have a freakishly sensitive stomach."
Dexbonus,Hope you feel better soon Dodger!!!
Dexbonus,"I went to Paris and a few smaller French towns on vacation and didn&#39;t encounter a single rude person. I took French in high school almost 10 years ago but if you try to use a few key phrases, the people were very welcoming and helpful."
Dexbonus,"Hey Dodger! I&#39;m starting to think we should start every coffeh time with French XD just ... too adorable :) also, your hair looks fantastic, what did you do to it? :O AND I hope you feel better soon, it sucks being sick when you&#39;re on holiday :\"
Dexbonus,"When Dogder is 80, she&#39;s gonna be the sweetest old lady..."
Dexbonus,20 min video HELLS YEAH! feel better soon Dodger!
Dexbonus,"True story: We didn&#39;t go to La Defonce (sp?) but around midnight my brother and I were hanging around outside by the Louvre and we noticed that people were randomly walking through the hedge maze opposite the Louvre. Not in groups either, there were people wandering around by themselves and there were like 8-10 of them. I&#39;m pretty sure they were either hedge maze enthusiasts or something weird was happening."
Dexbonus,"Fellow lactose intolerant person here! Also, I have a severe milk allergy. Trust me, there&#39;s a difference and it suuuucks, so I know what you&#39;re going through, Dodger. Feel better soon."
Dexbonus,"I&#39;m glad you are having a great time, Dodger!"
Dexbonus,Feel better Dodger! I get sick alot when I travel too cause my stomach is made of tissue paper or something. I&#39;d love to go to Europe one day. Hope you have fun!
Dexbonus,You know...I have to say...even though she is sick and has been sleeping...even with no make-up she still looks beautiful...
Dexbonus,Hope she feels better soon. It would certainly suck if she were sick the whole trip.
Dexbonus,"Dodger speaking French, my life is complete."
Dexbonus,"Dodger, both expressions were correct. Hope you recover well and fast, prompt rétablissement!"
Dexbonus,"Fuck yeah, 20 minutes of pure dodger 5 of which is just being cute."
Dexbonus,You know you&#39;ve been watching Wheezy&#39;s Daily Vlog too much if you expected this video to end at 11:52
Dexbonus,"Dodger, your french is really charming, it is really sweet and fluent :D"
Dexbonus,"Ri am not lactose intolerant, but I usually get an upset stomach whenever I travel in conjunction with different food. But anyways, I hope you feel better! You are living my dream to go to Paris!"
Dexbonus,I know I have been a good boy when dodger puts out a 20 min video shot in bed.
Dexbonus,best video ever!! I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re not feeling well Dodger :( Loved the fact this was 20+ minutes long ^^
Dexbonus,"I&#39;m sorry to hear you are having tummy problems. Sad you can&#39;t eat the delicious french food, without tummy ache. Still I&#39;m glad you awarded us with a extra long video today.Thank you for sharing your stories. Hope you keep having an amazing time in France.
I don&#39;t know any other countries where you take leftovers home, but then again I&#39;ve only been to a few countries, most of them in Europe. Maybe this is changing, by influence of American culture. But when in Rome, do as the Romans ..."
Dexbonus,"You just made my evening :)
Hope you get better soon and enjoy your trip! &lt;2 "
Dexbonus,Dodger seriously this needs to stop you&#39;re too adorable my heart can&#39;t take your cuteness even not feeling well you&#39;re way too cute lol Seriously though feel better!
Dexbonus,I like how when AxCrank types something in English on Twitter for practice someone will help him out in parts that are wrong.
Dexbonus,"This whole video made me either laugh or go &quot;Aww.. Poor thing..&quot;

But yeah as I&#39;m sure many others said, hopefully you feel better soon."
Dexbonus,C&#39;est drôle de te voir parler en Français (surtout avec un si bon accent) :D ! And I hope  you liked your trip in Paris! (I live there) A quick question why in your title you&#39;ve wrote &quot;Eau&quot;?
Dexbonus,Dodger finally gets excellent hair style for next tens years :)
Dexbonus,Get well soon so you can enjoy your trip Dodger.
Dexbonus,"Wow Dodger... as a French Canadian, that intro was super adorable. &lt;3 :D"
Dexbonus,Dodger ends up sick but somehow looks prettier than ever? How is that even possible?
Dexbonus,French is a rather pretty language and one of the more spoken languages in the world. Really no reason to expect the average French person to learn another language. Having lived in a tourist area with tourist attitudes I can understand if somebody doesn&#39;t want to talk to them. People turn their &quot;jerk &#39;tude&quot; on quite often when they vacation.
Dexbonus,I love how this is just basically uncut - awesome.
Dexbonus,"one time, I was on a field trip to a dairy farm, and they told us that if you drink unpasteurized milk for a few weeks, you&#39;ll have the effects of being lactose intolerant at first, but as the symptoms disappear (because they totally will), you&#39;ll never be lactose intolerant ever again

just something you might want to look up

also, I&#39;m liking this hairstyle, it&#39;s a refreshing change from the norm, and it looks nice"
Dexbonus,"Je suis un peu malade is the correct way to say it. As a french canadian hearing your accent gives my goosebumps goosebumps lol 
"
Dexbonus,"Amanda must envy you right now (for visiting France). ;p
Hope you feel better soon, and I&#39;m glad you are enjoying your stay in Paris. The vlogs are quite interesting to say the least, hopefully you&#39;ll be able to vlog outside the house too. And yes you do look like you&#39;re French, just put on a beret next time for complete blending."
Dexbonus,no apologies necessary dodger we love it when you make you videos long we encourage you to make longer videos

Dexbonus,"I think doogs have been in the UK for too long, she&#39;s turning into Harry Potter"
Dexbonus,i know shes really annoyed of sherlock but i hope she finishes it bc theres no way im playing it myself LOL
Dexbonus,Poor Dodger is suffering through this game but it&#39;s still fun to watch this playthrough &#39;xD
Dexbonus,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcRQj2OHBMU&amp;t=2h38m14s"">2:38:14</a> I just realized Sherlock getting the Beehive is a reference to that one time in Crimes &amp; Punishments when Watson walks into 221B for a faceful of Sherlock&#39;s bees 😄"
Dexbonus,"I imagine Dodger walking around the lawn, all happy and care free, and with every step makes that walking sqeaky sound from cat poke. I hope your father will be happy with those new controllers Dodge, also Ro is doing another Livestream on saturday, she is becoming a livestream addict. :)"
Dexbonus,I got a good laugh at how she seemed so genuinely surprised at how awake she was. 
Dexbonus,"T-shirt,hair long ,chilling with no makeup on that&#39;s when she&#39;s the prettiest i hope she doesn&#39;t take it wrong "
Dexbonus,"Right? I&#39;m with you. Dodger may not always have the best stories or the stories one might not be looking for, but damn is she one hell of a story teller. It&#39;s just the way she does it! Back when I used to play WoW I&#39;d just have her on as my background noise when I was doing whatever. Quests, random dungeons, random battlegrounds. Had her videos on shuffle like she was my music. Of course I&#39;d alt tab a lot on new videos when she would mimic or show us something."
Dexbonus,"Silly Dodger is silly tonight. And just as I was thinking that she was getting sillier, she mentioned how we could probably notice her waking up. Correlation achieved."
Dexbonus,"Dodger, growing your own food and eating it is the most amazing feeling! I totally agree with you. "
Dexbonus,"thank you for taking your time to make the videos. because usually i&#39;m one of those guys it&#39;s hard to find a present for. but your little 10-12 minutes of sunshine everyday are a really great gift.
you&#39;re one of the greratest ladyfaces out there ;)"
Dexbonus,My parents used to own a bakery and I can totally relate to making your own food being the best food. I think I got kind of spoiled by our bread as today I only like very high quality bread and cake :)
Dexbonus,"I don&#39;t know why, this girl makes me smile.  Thank you."
Dexbonus,I can never take my attention away from the video. Because then I miss all of her hilarious expressions.
Dexbonus,"I love the beginning of this because my desk is at the foot of my bed, so there literally is a huge bed right behind me. "
Dexbonus,Once your body gets used to the caffeine it doesn&#39;t really have the same effect anymore. I can drink like a pint of coffee and go to sleep immediately.
Dexbonus,Even though you looked great yesterday it&#39;s nice to have the old Dodger back today :) 
Dexbonus,I cant believe you can actually fall asleep with all that coffee you&#39;ve been drinking &gt;.&lt;
Dexbonus,"That nose twitch as she switches off the camera, so cute!"
Dexbonus,Dodger! &lt;3 Your normal new hair looks luvly :) Glad you&#39;re having a great time time back home!
Dexbonus,"Oh my gosh!! My mom&#39;s first home-made batch of Kombucha just got done, and I was able to try some. It was really good. If its something you really like, I&#39;d suggest saving up glass bottles or something to store it in once its ready for drinking."
Dexbonus,"She isn&#39;t selling herself, she is just talking and it happens to go into that box, its like ghost protocol man!"
Dexbonus,"I expect most &quot;custom&quot; apparel to be pullover versus zip-up. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s cheaper, but it features the graphic on it better. Though I prefer zip-up because for me they&#39;re just easier to get on and off and won&#39;t mess with your head (Like physically mess with your face and hair)."
Dexbonus,"I think you should do some Coffeh episodes in your old bedroom (if your parent&#39;s haven&#39;t done anything with it, that is). Would bring back some memories for the long-hauler subs like me :)."
Dexbonus,"Am I the only one that could see Dodger walking around on the lawn saying things like that with dramatic excitement?
"
Dexbonus,"Ma&#39;am, we are pleased to announce that your hair is going to make a full recover. You may come back during visiting hours."
Dexbonus,"Naps, haircuts... it&#39;s like you&#39;re on a rejuvenating retreat. Good for you. :)"
Dexbonus,"If Dodger were to make vinegar, it would be the sweetest and most delicious vinegar ever, people would drink to her health with said vinegar and the world would be a better place..."
Dexbonus,Mr. Squirrel and The Mighty Slugs sounds like it should be a cartoon show or something.  
Dexbonus,That&#39;s awesome that someone still makes brand new NES controllers. I think I may need some of them.
Dexbonus,"Oh Dodger, I&#39;m sure you made Courtney so proud with your probiotics XD"
Dexbonus,"Hah, nothing gets me to do things harder than someone saying that they doubt I could do it. :)

Most of my family is hard to buy gifts for, too. But there&#39;s always that one thing that&#39;s just fantastic to get for people."
Dexbonus,You&#39;re my fucking hero. People should hire you to counter-stalk E-stalkers.
Dexbonus,"For some reason, my brain seems to believe it is because she was pro at dodge ball. WHAT, it makes sense! She&#39;s a small target!"
Dexbonus,"Hard time buying your father a present?

Buy him a tie, its REALLY original and always effective."
Dexbonus,I want to see Dodger cold-turkey caffeine sometime for like a week. It&#39;d be both painful and enjoyable to watch. Sadomasochism ftw?
Dexbonus,Dodger lives in our closets. She secretly lives in Monster&#39;s Inc. She has access to all of our closets.
Dexbonus,Yes! idietoskate is still around! Reading his comments puts me in tears lmao.
Dexbonus,"MERCHANDISING, MERCHANDISING, MERCHANDISING!

Dodger the t-shirt, Dodger the coffee mug, Dodger the wristband, Dodger the FLAMETHROWER! *fires flamethrower* The kids love this one."
Dexbonus,"Mr Squirrel and the Mighty Slugs, sounds like an amazing band name!!!"
Dexbonus,Courtney has her own kombucha growing starting kit
Dexbonus,Holy shit! So THAT&#39;S what Dodger looks like when she isn&#39;t dying her hair or having makeup on! Not bad! ;)
Dexbonus,"I heard you (and I thing Courtney) mention Kombucha before, but never looked it up. I just figured it was some kind of herbal tea or something. Now that I did Wiki it I&#39;m curious what it tastes like. I always want to try new things to eat and/or drink. I never made my own vinegar but I do understand the process. The &#39;mother&#39; is the culture of micro organisms you need for the fermentation process. It&#39;s the same with yeast for alcohol and the bacteria for yogurt and/or cheese etc."
Dexbonus,"YAY Kombucha!!! I miss it, our family needs to makes it more.
"
Dexbonus,Squirrels were eating my parents orchids and I think they got rid of them by buying a plastic owl that hoots when it senses something is close maybe try that to defend the peas and other stuff  :)
Dexbonus,"i love watching these when i have coffee
"
Dexbonus,do you know if Courtney started brewing kombucha yet? because with every batch another SCOBY (mother/fungus) so she could totes hook you up. also if you let the brew for a long time it get a more vinegar taste and you can use it as vinegar.
Dexbonus,Glad you&#39;re finally taking care of your hair!
Dexbonus,"I love you so much it hurts....to Brooke&#39;s family, i dont mean to sound like a creeper, but your daughter is one of the most beautiful things i have seen, but can never have.

Sincerely
- Adolescent Male"
Dexbonus,"so true, nothing beats a salad where all the ingredients come from your own garden..."
Dexbonus,"That was a cool gift to get your dad. My dad&#39;s birthday was yesterday, and we went to see the Amazing Spiderman together."
Dexbonus,Home grown salad does sound pretty cool. 
Dexbonus,is it just me or do dodger remind anyone of day9? so happy and telling stories love it :)
Dexbonus,I wish coffee lasts forever!!!!!
Dexbonus,We&#39;re witnessing Dodgers transformation into a 2010&#39;s skater boy!😂
Dexbonus,"Doogers is rocking that lesbian energy.<br><br>Seriously though, fantastic haircut."
Dexbonus,It’s funny she keeps talking about vampires considering she has not aged since 2012
Dexbonus,Omg I love your hair 🧡
Dexbonus,Real OGs remember the orange and white dyed fox ear bangs
Dexbonus,I like it better than the previous mom haircut. But only because I&#39;m into tomboys.
Dexbonus,"on the subject of being the age we are… i am sending this from the afterlife, cause i just heard a song from the same year as “all the small things” on a “ classic rock station”"
Dexbonus,"Do you ever change stream schedules? I can finally sub but I realised that I can&#39;t watch any streams live as most at midnight-5am in New Zealand 😅 will still sub anyway because I love the content, I&#39;m not trying to guilt-trip at all haha, just wondering as I&#39;d love to catch your streams live."
Dexbonus,Great new haircut
Dexbonus,Omg your hair is so cuteeee 💕
Dexbonus,Sorry if this has been answered elsewhere but why didn&#39;t she just use Presshearttocontinue to upload these?
Dexbonus,damn gina
Dexbonus,Hackers (1995)
Dexbonus,Your hair is soooooo cute ahhhh im gay
Dexbonus,Oh no 😅
Dexbonus,🥺
Dexbonus,Why is Ellen on Dodgers Channel
Dexbonus,Now you look like Ellen Degeneres :/
Dexbonus,"I&#39;d like to see Jesse open one of the COFFEH episodes with &quot;hey motherfuckers, it&#39;s beer time!&quot;.<br>At first the idea was to get Bruce Willis to do it but I don&#39;t know if Bruce does that kind of gigs anymore.."
Dexbonus,Anyone else expect this to happen?<br><br>&quot;Guys I gave myself the worst burn today. It was siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick. Sick burn.&quot;
Dexbonus,"I feel so lame, but my favorite show on TV right now is Teen Wolf on MTV. It&#39;s just such a good show, it&#39;s completely unlike any other MTV show, because the story is so deep and actually interesting. Are there any other fans that feel the same, or am I the only one?"
Dexbonus,"Lettuce Secret: Hold the head of lettuce in your hands and bang the stem stub down on the counter/divider of your sink. Then flip it over, grab the stub and quickly twist/pull to &quot;unscrew it&#39; from the  head. Then set it upside down under a slowly running, cold tap. After a couple of minute, flip it right-side-up and let it drain.<br><br>You should have no further trouble with lettuce wraps."
Dexbonus,Is it me or is the way she pauses and swallows because she has to think in order to say more words really adorable?
Dexbonus,Hannibal is so great. I can&#39;t believe the ratings are so low. Everyone I&#39;ve got onto that show says they love it and its amazing. I don&#39;t understand how people have just stopped watching.
Dexbonus,"Don&#39;t put Vaseline (or other oils, butter is suggested a lot, too). Can make it not heal properly/slower. A little burn liek that is no biggie, but if you blister up, don&#39;t do it. Also be careful with iced water or direct ice cubes, your sense of touch is all whack while burned, and can damage your skin without realizing. Again probs fine here. The more you know!"
Dexbonus,this is how it went in my head<br>person: is that burner hot<br>dodger puts had on burner<br>dodger:.....yup......<br>her eyes begin to water before she finally picks her hand up and looks at it<br>dodger:.......AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br>other person jumps back in fear
Dexbonus,The filter on Hell On Wheels is so beautiful too. It always makes it look like an early morning
Dexbonus,Don&#39;t put ice directly on your burn Dodger!
Dexbonus,"Whaaaat? I had no idea Hannibal&#39;s ratings were down so much. That makes me really sad. I guess I&#39;m gonna have to rewatch it on Hulu a million times lol. Also, you should watch True Detective! I get a bit of a Hannibal-esque vibe from it in the gorgeous aesthetics department. It&#39;s also a really great show. :) "
Dexbonus,"Its amazing how many doctors watch your vlogs Dodger, everyone seems to have a completely different cure for burns."
Dexbonus,"DON&quot;T PUT ICE ON BURNS!<br>Run it under cold water for like, 20 mins. But never ice a burn directly. You can cause more injury to the burned area. "
Dexbonus,"I was really hungry one day and so I put about a pound of fries into the oven to cook, since that&#39;s what I was craving. So I&#39;m watching TV in the next room and the timer goes off. I&#39;m like &quot;yeah, fries are done!&quot; Go to the oven, take out the fries and put them on the stove, close the oven. I looked at my hands and said &quot;why are my hands tingling? Oh. Right, oven gloves.&quot; Whoops. Lol.<br><br>Also, I think the mug you used in this episode is just awesome. Love it."
Dexbonus,"Hannibal is AMAZING, really wish it was getting more love."
Dexbonus,Thank you Dodger! Hope you have an amazing day! Keep up the good work. And please stop with the burning of you! Take care! :)
Dexbonus,"I think if you get some indoor plants, they can help balance the humidity inside your apartment!"
Dexbonus,That mug is so dope! X3
Dexbonus,"Hannibal&#39;s ratings look fine, i&#39;ve never looked at ratings numbers much before so maybe i&#39;m misunderstanding them, but i&#39;m reading that the show&#39;s doing as well as last year. Which is great, because i was addicted from day one and i hope more people fall in love with this beautiful show (that is so detailed it makes you hungry, even though half the time you know it&#39;s soylent green)."
Dexbonus,"The days of the week in the Dodgerverse: Monday, Podcastday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friendzoneday, Newzday, Sunday. Also everyday is Caturday."
Dexbonus,"Protip if you burn yourself- Cover affected area lightly with antiseptic cream such as Germoline ( which also has a mild anaesthetic ), and then hold a cold can of pop on the area. It works best if you have 2 cans and rotate them in and out of the fridge as they warm."
Dexbonus,Dodger is confused when people don&#39;t start to get interested in shows at the same time when she is. How rude! :D
Dexbonus,Just a tip. The best way to treat a burn. cool it rapidly in cold water for about a minute then switch to lukewarm to warm water to restore the blood circulation.<br>Then if you have it apply Flamazine(the stuff they also use in hospitals). This is not only fatty like vasiline it also has a bit of a painkiller effect to it and is antibacterial so it won&#39;t get infected.
Dexbonus,If you like cooking so much have you ever thought of doing a cooking show? 
Dexbonus,Actually caught the premiere of Believe. And I think that show is going places. I actually thought it was very compelling. You should check it out.
Dexbonus,Orphan black is my favorite show right now... Sooooo good!
Dexbonus,Smack the lettuce head on the counter with the bulb bit hitting the counter. It will detach from the leaves super easy without ripping the leaves. Then they aren&#39;t attached either so they just peel apart.
Dexbonus,"For getting the bulb thingy out of a head of lettuce. Just smack it hard on a flat surface a few times. That always works for me. There will be a couple of pieces still connected, but most will come off."
Dexbonus,"I enjoyed Hannibal when it was on Thursday nights.  I realize that watching it on the network channel the day that it first airs isn&#39;t as important for ratings as it used to be for all television in the past, but I do believe that doesn&#39;t make it unimportant either.  I just hope that moving it to Friday nights isn&#39;t the kiss of death for it like it has been for many other decent TV shows in the past."
Dexbonus,We normally just buy a meatloaf from the local supermarket pre-made and ready to slip in the oven.<br>One thing I have made in the past though is a cross between a meatloaf and a Scotch egg.<br>Instead of wrapping the egg in sausage meat I have used a meatloaf mix instead to wrap the egg.
Dexbonus,"Well, I bought the first season and loved it. And I was just reminded that season 2 Hannibal started already. Thanks for the heads up."
Dexbonus,"I totally heard <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdeAZ7I1VvY&amp;t=7m33s"">7:33</a> as &quot;I wanna bling my oven&quot; and I was like is that a thing? Do people bling their ovens?"
Dexbonus,I&#39;m seriously doubting the skillz of your friend in the medical field if that is the way he treated a burn.
Dexbonus,"My big problem with keeping up with TV shows is when I only watch one or two shows on that network. Once the season ends or they do that stupid mid season finale shenanigans I have no reason to keep watching their network, so I end up missing the announcements for when my show is coming back. And then there&#39;s also the ones that get stealth cancelled. Those are super fun to deal with. No less than 3 shows that i enjoy have been announced as entering or already in their final season out of nowhere. Its just annoying."
Dexbonus,"I so agree with you on Hannibal, that show is amazing."
Dexbonus,"I did the same thing as you to test whether something was hot, I dropped a sparkler on the floor and was wondering how hot it was so picked it up where it was burning, turns out that they&#39;re basically molten..."
Dexbonus,"If your oven heats unevenly, try buying an unglazed ceramic tile. The unglazed tile acts like a thermal sponge holding and better distributing the heat you oven is putting out. Just give your oven. Enough time to heat properly before you use it.  "
Dexbonus,"Better than Ice for a burn is Vinegar, if you hold a vinegar soaked cloth or paper towel on a burn it pulls the heat from the wound like ice does without the painful numbing of the surrounding area; vinegar smells and lingers on your skin though."
Dexbonus,"a home remedy for burns ive seen my friend use (and it works) clean the burn under a faucet as you normally would and damp dry, then cover the burn with salt and let it sit. the salt draws out the fluid from the burn and prevents the blister from forming"
Dexbonus,"Just watched the first 2 episodes of Hannibal, and I&#39;m already hooked."
Dexbonus,I know that a shit ton of people are uploading videos of The Stick of Truth but I honestly would love to see a 1-CUP of it. Those are ma feels.
Dexbonus,just put honey on a burn! helps a lot and my granpa think&#39;s it helps with literally everything.. I think he would even bring it to the hospital if he ever needs an operation xD but for burns is does really help! one time my mom poored a pan of boiling hot water on her chest.. she just put half a jar of honey on there and stuck her shirt to is and it healed completely
Dexbonus,"Last time I burned myself (that wasn&#39;t sunburn), I was in art class and accidentally touched the metal end where the glue comes out with my right index fingertip which has no feeling due to a separate accident a few years earlier. I look down and the fingertip had a blister formed.<br><br>Made for an interesting conversation with the school nurse."
Dexbonus,"When I burn myself I usually just put it under the coldest water from the tap until it hurts from the cold. Then it&#39;s just red and a bit itchy for a couple of days.<br>And yes, 2 big computers create a lot of heat. We have our heating turned down as much as we can (they&#39;re at the lowest setting but still warm for some reason) but our apartment is still hot as hell. Personally I get cold a lot, so I love it, but my boyfriend always think it&#39;s too hot."
Dexbonus,"YOOOO tip for lettuce! I thought this was real dumb when my mom first showed me but i&#39;ve never had issues with lettuce. What you do is that you grab the top of the lettuce...ball? and you smash the stem part onto the counter  hard, just once. And then flip the lettuce...ball? over and that stem thing should be able to be pulled out easily. or at least give it a twist and you&#39;re good to go."
Dexbonus,I&#39;m the weirdo that thinks that green peppers (no aurocarrot I didn&#39;t mean green lepers) are the best. Love to eat them raw 😊
Dexbonus,I literally thought she quit YouTube until I found this channel lol
Dexbonus,I swear you could wear Clarkie&#39;s clothes and they would still be too big!
Dexbonus,I can&#39;t imagine trying to wear something I bought in middle school.  The fabric would have to be very stretchy or it would tear.
Dexbonus,Are you drinking out of a large salsa container? I drink out of old pasta sauce containers.
Dexbonus,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZtge3r3dnU&amp;t=00h00m28s"">00:00:28</a> she’s on screen<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZtge3r3dnU&amp;t=02h10m29s"">02:10:29</a> she’s done BLM!!!✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿"
Dexbonus,First 👍
Dexbonus,I never would have believed that a howling baby would be the cutest thing ever.
Dexbonus,Thank you for being you ❤
Dexbonus,I hope the little one is doing okay.
Dexbonus,"for me it was to total opposite I adored dark crystal but Labyrinth freaked me out, I&#39;ve avoided David Bowie a lot because of it those tights man they scarred me."
Dexbonus,Someone already said it but you should play Man of Medan...<br> with Jesse Cox!! I luv all your laughs and funny moments in you guys&#39; playthroughs lol
Dexbonus,"Hi, I hope you&#39;re doing fine my dude!"
Dexbonus,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xobKAAVYvjk&amp;t=42m05s"">42:05</a> she’s back with her kid"
Dexbonus,"And so the Warrior king was reborn, soon Neo Sparta shall rise once more."
Dexbonus,"IF you do Man of Medan, i would love to watch it. just like until dawn, I remember that stream from england with sam :)"
Dexbonus,&quot;I have some kind of a sick&quot; im gonna start saying that now. Lol work will probably be cool with it lol
Dexbonus,Man does that kid look like Sam.
Dexbonus,"Dodger is just so adorable like how, how do you manage to be so damn adorable"
Dexbonus,YAY! I&#39;m so glad. We had a blast :)
Dexbonus,Dooger and Jenn were so adorable together and the make over was super awesome! and dooger is always super adorable and her hair is amazeballs but jenn did an incredible job! ^_^
Dexbonus,Thank-you for putting a video out everyday on Dexbonus this week. You&#39;ve been up super early every morning for BullseyeU and Polaris this week and you are still going strong even with your sore throat. You are an AWESOME babe and your Burritos love you for it xoxox
Dexbonus,your segment with Jenn was my favorite part today at BullseyeU &lt;3
Dexbonus,I so want the next coffeh time to start with her saying My name is Alice and I remember everything
Dexbonus,"Dodger, you look so great ! I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re losing your voice :(  thank you for making my week! watching you at Bullseye University was so much fun!"
Dexbonus,I love how the smile you had did not come off your face for the entire episode. 
Dexbonus,dammit dodger you&#39;re killing me with all the ways you look amazing. I swear you can apparently make anything look amazing
Dexbonus,"hope Dodger feels better, she&#39;s beautiful and I like hearing her talk... I&#39;m not weird I swear :x"
Dexbonus,"I only now realized that, not only is she the most Awesomer, incredibly adorable and possibly the Greatest youtube personally EVER!!!! But Dodger also has merc AND basically runs her own business. Respect bar triple leveled and Mind BLOWN!!!! POW!!"
Dexbonus,Playing Celebrity was so great &amp; I think it is awesome that you &amp; MeekaKitty are hitting it off so well :)
Dexbonus,"Sore-Throat Dodger sounds really, really sincere. And also in need of hugs."
Dexbonus,"There are days the cat just wants to be a part of the vlog. I have a bunch of friends who are singers and I&#39;m trying right now to think of what they say they do when their voices go out. But my memory done went out. Anyway, I hope you get better soon.  :)"
Dexbonus,"Feel Better,Please! Dodger! Was great to see you and Tessa Hanging out at Bullseye U.
Take care of your self!! :)"
Dexbonus,&quot;Once we realize we were ok with experimenting it wound up being real fun&quot; I fucking loled
Dexbonus,"Yep!   Great look for you, Dodger.  Hope your voice feels better soon."
Dexbonus,Please do celebrity livestreams! That would be so much fun :D I had a ton of fun last night playing with you and Tessa &lt;3
Dexbonus,"Happy for you and the project!

Have to say, with the faint voice, you are sounding totes adorbs!! x^D"
Dexbonus,Dodger you&#39;ve been a busy girl lately. You&#39;re doing so much and doing it well keep it up!
Dexbonus,Take care of your voice. Looking forward to another fun day tomorrow.
Dexbonus,"Aw, I can tell your voice is going. I hope it heals!:("
Dexbonus,Not to join everyone else but; Dooger looks so much more beautiful today than usual
Dexbonus,Can&#39;t wait for the Broken Quest premier live stream on the 25th. For once working a retail job with random days off is gonna pay off and ill get to watch.
Dexbonus,"Wow I love your half gone voice!
It chills me out :)"
Dexbonus,Ro&#39;s video gives away who voices which characters since she has a poster thing of all the characters. Pretty easy to figure out who&#39;s who. 
Dexbonus,"Celebrity was tons of fun! I&#39;d definitely be down for playing it in another stream. As for broken quest, I think you&#39;ll play the character with some obscure color of hair."
Dexbonus,hope your voice gets better Dodger! try not to dooger too hard!
Dexbonus,Drink Black Chai Tea it has a lot of antioxidents in it and it&#39;s great for people who sing! I hope you feel better Dodger!
Dexbonus,Celebrity &quot;10 to 30 questions&quot; was so much fun with you guys! Hahaha :P
Dexbonus,You&#39;re so pretty and seem so happy during every video :D keep making them !!
Dexbonus,Her hair does look really nice today :)
Dexbonus,I really didn&#39;t expect to see dodger with such a regular hair color. Wow; looks awesome btw. 
Dexbonus,"&quot;Hey guys, it&#39;s ginger ale time!&quot;

I&#39;ll be waiting, Dodger."
Dexbonus,Jenn did a great job :)
Dexbonus,You should drink hot lemon tea with honey. It does the trick for me whenever I lose my voice. Feel better! 
Dexbonus,"I&#39;ve watched the makeup session you did with Jenn and wow, she seems like such a nice person!! You two had a very nice chemistry, seems like you could have a natural friendship. Enough of a nice interaction to make a guy watch way too long two girls and makeup :P"
Dexbonus,awww dodge im sorry your losing your voice hope you get it back soon
Dexbonus,"Oh my...everyone...Dodger has become an adult. A REAL adult, not like us anymore. :&#39;( Dodger, come back to the dark side!"
Dexbonus,get well soon!!! we all love you (even the pervy bastards)!
Dexbonus,"Poor dodger.
Get well soon!"
Dexbonus,Hope your throat gets better Dodger.
Dexbonus,"Now judging from looking at the flyer of Broken Quest ( and I know this is a wild stab at the dark here, but hear me out ) I think Dodger&#39;s character is... the green haired girl.

WHAT A TWIST!"
Dexbonus,i loved watching you and jenn during the makeover. ^_^
Dexbonus,Ahhh I know you are worried about you voice. But raspy dodger voice is just too seductive.
Dexbonus,"this was so fun playing w/ u guys
"
Dexbonus,"I was kind of expecting the &quot;Celebrity&quot; game demonstration to spiral out of control into Dodger being uncomfortably honest with what she thinks of herself. I feel like there&#39;s a skit in that, somewhere."
Dexbonus,"I think Dogers needs to not do videos for like 3 or 4 days, so her throat gets better. YOU HAVE OUR PERMISION TO DO SO DOGES! "
Dexbonus,"Out-of-context-Dodger quote of the day at 3:03 - 3:18
&quot;...she had just never done on another person. And so she kept like trying things and she&#39;d go &quot;mmm?&quot;, and then we&#39;d try something else. And i think once we both realized that we were really OK with just experimenting, it wound up being really fun&quot;"
Dexbonus,Dodgers hair looks stunning today.
Dexbonus,Clarke assert dominance over santa XD XD XD
Dexbonus,Hashtag thin hair problems. All the hairstyles online are for thick hair and they all look AMAZING and it makes me sad. A

Dexbonus,I had a nightmare that I had been reading &quot;dexbonus&quot; wrong all along and it was actually &quot;ducksboners&quot;
Dexbonus,I gotta finish this game.
Dexbonus,Chat must have been about to blow up for the 20 minutes she was stuck in that button part. Sucks that the controls aren&#39;t explained better.
Dexbonus,Omg the sound of dragging the metal box
Dexbonus,Dodger cusses and all of a sudden says shoot😋
Dexbonus,If anyone actually ever sees this. Is there a part 2 with the end of the DLC anywhere? I couldn&#39;t find it.
Dexbonus,It’s so frustrating watching her ahahaha
Dexbonus,Please can you play Bugsnax soon. It is an amazing game full of weird mysteries and all sorts of unexpected things. (I cant give too much away due to spoilers) it is a game which I know that you will love. 💗💗 I hope that you give it a go. (It would be good as a stream game that the vod comes to YouTube) it isn&#39;t a very long game but it is something worth experiencing 💗💗
Dexbonus,Even in HD I cannot see anything...
Dexbonus,Nice
Dexbonus,I wish I was 32 again.  The last decade was terrible.  Actually the last 2 decades.  Actually the last 3 decades.  Basically anything after the 80s completely sucked.

Dexbonus,"i havent watched any of these videos, i just enjoy seeing her uploading the lyrics. we&#39;re almost at the gooood part, yall!"
Dexbonus,This game gives off huge maze runner vibes for some reason
Dexbonus,"It&#39;s so painful hearing everyone talking about not finding weapons when Dodger finds a ton of extra assault rifles and don&#39;t say anything. <br><br>&quot;Dodger, have you looted this house?&quot;<br>&quot;Yea.&quot;"
Dexbonus,It&#39;s cool to watch. I&#39;m way too old to play this...I&#39;d get started and some tween would smoke me. 😐

Dexbonus,Thank you for putting these on YT.  I&#39;m almost never able to catch a stream.  Appreciate you!
Dexbonus,The clarkey Max story is too cute
Dexbonus,its all fun and games tis Clarkie screams grumpy and Dooger have to BRB stream
Dexbonus,Excite to see more of Gato Roboto! Still got the ventilation system to clear.
Dexbonus,"I&#39;m not going to lie.  I find myself singing &quot;Domo arigato, Gato Roboto&quot; every time you mention the title."
Dexbonus,Dodger thanks for the awesome gameplay
Dexbonus,Sup girl
Dexbonus,"Dark Souls? <b>shrugs</b><br>Watching Dodger take off make up? Weirdly entertaining.<br><br>Not that I&#39;m going to stop watching, but today is a day that I questioning why I watch coffee time.  DON&#39;T EVER CHANGE COFFEE TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Dexbonus,"It makes me so so so happy to know you&#39;re happy, Dodger!"
Dexbonus,I&#39;m sure at least in part your sadness the other day could be due to TB. Can only imagine how hard it must be to see a close friend go through that. Wishing him and his family all the best.
Dexbonus,Dodger is the only woman who can get me to watch her removing makeup. And she looks equally pretty afterwards. It must be witchcraft.
Dexbonus,"&quot;Glitter, the herpes of makeup and craft supplies.&quot; -Dodger, 5-3-2014"
Dexbonus,&quot;Herpes of makeup and craft supplies&quot; might be an early frontrunner for &quot;funniest coffee time line of May.&quot;
Dexbonus,"It&#39;s okay if you mistake a shoe for a creature, Dodger. I once mistook a blue pickup truck for a grey heron."
Dexbonus,"Even when you clean your face, it still gets glitchy. :p"
Dexbonus,Dodger put on her serious face at the end.
Dexbonus,"It&#39;s always amazing to see when some people like Dodger take off their makeup, they end up being more beautiful than before. Makes me wonder why they use it. Definitely not to cover up their ugliness, like most of us people."
Dexbonus,After watching Friend Zone today I hope someone does some fan art of a chicken from and alternative universe in a Chad Kigurumi.
Dexbonus,use vaseline! it takes makeup off super fast and leaves your skin feeling smooth (:
Dexbonus,I wish my normal state of mind was &quot;generally happy&quot; :( Guess Dodger&#39;s just cool like that.
Dexbonus,So apparently Dodger&#39;s viewers that don&#39;t use make up wipes also speak Simlish.
Dexbonus,"Hi Dodger, i allways miss your streams, why don&#39;t you make an &quot;Hi there, i&#39;m streaming&quot; video when you are up for some? <br>PS: love your videos, they allways make my day"
Dexbonus,this is borderline an asmr video 
Dexbonus,&#39;I thought there was a creature in my room&#39; <br>Sly fox hound get out of dodgers room! Ba dum tsssh
Dexbonus,"I use the micro-delivery exfoliating wash or any other good face cleansers, but those wipes aren&#39;t really good for your skin! "
Dexbonus,"Actually, those are for oily/combo skin, the blue ones are for normal skin"
Dexbonus,Is there any chance you could stream at a time that it better for the brits? I know you might be busy with life but checking the past broadcasts and seeing that last night&#39;s stream started at 4-5am is a bit daunting ^^;
Dexbonus,"I was so sad that I couldn&#39;t watch the full stream live, I just got too tired and it was nearly 2 am in NY, eh, at least I can still watch it on Twitch."
Dexbonus,Given one of the well known properties of coffee... maybe not the best title?
Dexbonus,"What does the oil smell like, Dodger? I neeeeeed to know."
Dexbonus,"More Dark Souls to watch, YAY!!! Oh gosh, I&#39;m never going to get my homework done.    :P"

Dexbonus,The sound is a bit bad compared to normal quality.
Dexbonus,Sealab 2021!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh the memories... the salty salty memories.
Dexbonus,In Britain they call flash lights a torch. What do they call a torch?
Dexbonus,Anyone else getting some audio crackliness in the last half of this video?
Dexbonus,&quot;Somebody did a double dip in my coconut oil&quot; (☉_☉)
Dexbonus,Do yourself a favour and get yourself an oil free moisturiser because it won&#39;t give you zits but it&#39;ll put the moisture back in your face so you can afford using the deep clean wipes without RUINING your skin. Just saying from experience
Dexbonus,i sooo wannna be a producer now id just whisper murderous things and say i didn&#39;t say anything to make them think they are insane 
Dexbonus,"Sea Lab, underneath the water.  Sea lab, at the bottom of the sea."

Dexbonus,Poor audio :(
Dexbonus,Can I recommend a different video encoder while recording coffee time. 
Dexbonus,The one thumbs down is from Vinny.......  :)
Dexbonus," If you rub your eyes that hard when taking off makeup, you are going to end up with major eye wrinkles/bags in 10/15 years. Be more gentle Dooger."
Dexbonus,my friend uses olive oil to remove makeup.
Youtuber,Comments
GamingWithJen,Minecraft Fails should be a new series that would be amazing XD
GamingWithJen,"Nice to see the failures every now and then, but was still just as entertaining!  Thank you for posting this little embarrassment! ♥"
GamingWithJen,I think these two people are the only ones that keep Minecraft alive..<br><br><br><br><br><br>Keep up the good work =3
GamingWithJen,i would love to see more bloopers in more mod showcases. Maybe post more?
GamingWithJen,Haha yes! You guys should totally do this more! Upload fails/blooper videos on Jens channel!! Be totally awesome!
GamingWithJen,Hi Jen I absolutely love your personality. Your one of my favorite youtubers thank you Jen. 😀
GamingWithJen,"Now what&#39;s funny is that the video ended and I thought &quot;Where&#39;s the rest of the fails?&quot; but then I remember &quot;oh yea, they stopped the custom command showcase and had to start over&quot; XD"
GamingWithJen,This was so funny! Y&#39;all could make this a series if you save your fails and some off screen moments! That should be pretty easy to do!
GamingWithJen,"Pat and Jen, thank you for all the good laughs in this video!"
GamingWithJen,you guys really need to make this a series
GamingWithJen,&quot;This is the most amazing video ever created.&quot;<br><br><br>~Jen
GamingWithJen,i think a fail montage would be better.. like just compile them..<br><br>also I&#39;ve been dying to see Jen&#39;s POV when you are playing.. especially on challenge games so we can all see what she gets when she opens lucky blocks.. same video just her POV..
GamingWithJen,Who has been Waiting for this Forever!!! So many fails!!!
GamingWithJen,"They got alot of fails, I&#39;m really proud of them! :P"
GamingWithJen,You achieved some great fails today pat.
GamingWithJen,What you both should do is either an epic fails montage or a funny moments montage
GamingWithJen,You guys should do this sort of thing more often
GamingWithJen,It was too funny how many times he failed to make the dragon egg part work XD
GamingWithJen,this so funny😂😂😂
GamingWithJen,"OMG I LOVE SEEING THEIR FAILS, TOO FUNNY"
GamingWithJen,so good. im glad you guys posted this.
GamingWithJen,This would be a pretty cool animation video.
GamingWithJen,GUYS MAKE MORE OF THESE!!! I LOVE THIS!!
GamingWithJen,"Pat, when u do these mod reviews, you have to make sure u look up the mod and see what u have to do so u don&#39;t make so many mistakes!!!!!!"
GamingWithJen,this is very funny pat has sooo many fails in this video!!😂😂😂😂😆
GamingWithJen,Make this a series please.
GamingWithJen,YOU SHOULD MAKE THIS A SERIES!!! If you do it should be called Epic Fail Videos
GamingWithJen,MAKE MORE FAIL VIDEOS! PLEASE!
GamingWithJen,Fail counter: OVER 9000<br>Continue making great vids guys!
GamingWithJen,"You know you can throw an entire stack on the ground while it&#39;s in your hand, right? just press Q and tab...."
GamingWithJen,I was laughing almost through out the whole video
GamingWithJen,do this more often its hilarious
GamingWithJen,The next How to Train Your Dragon is looking pretty good!
GamingWithJen,I wonder how many fails they did the most in one video?
GamingWithJen,This would be every mod showcase run by Jen.
GamingWithJen,I got this mod last night!!! I hatched my ice dragon this morning!
GamingWithJen,This made my life complete! 🙃🙃🙃
GamingWithJen,"I love it when they fail,they should do this for every fail video😂😂😂😂😂"
GamingWithJen,Hilarious!! you should have more fail videos
GamingWithJen,"i &lt;3 the fails. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FailCityForTheWin"">#FailCityForTheWin</a>"
GamingWithJen,I love how they just gave up at the end randomly
GamingWithJen,you should fight one of those dragons in the challenge games.
GamingWithJen,"Lol.. Fifteen fails... In one 7  minute video... Wow, I didn&#39;t know that was possible."
GamingWithJen,This needs to be a series
GamingWithJen,You know you want more of these when you want more of these.
GamingWithJen,"So, clear this up for me... You DON&#39;T need a mod to do this?"
GamingWithJen,her intro makes my soul live again&lt;3
GamingWithJen,I love Jen&#39;s intro!
GamingWithJen,I missed her intro!😭😭💕💕

GamingWithJen,I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve already figured it out since you posted this video.  The only places that auto updates your total level is the Bowling alley and Black Market.  Other than that you have to leave the game and re-enter the game.

GamingWithJen,Who else wants Jen to start using a face cam ? I think it would be really cool to see her reaction when playing
GamingWithJen,Jen: <b>gets a boyfriend</b><br>Everyone: <b>supportive</b><br>Pat: <b>gets a girlfriend</b><br>Everyone: <b>So you have chosen death</b>
GamingWithJen,"instead of saying, “i miss pat” and etc, remember that jen is happier now and thats all it matters. yes i do miss jen and pat, but they both seem like they have moved on with their lives and we should too. great video jen !"
GamingWithJen,Jen: <b>gets a boyfriend</b> <br>Everyone: <b>supportive</b><br>Pat: <b>INTRODUCES A NEW GIRL</b><br>Everyone: “so you wish to suffer”
GamingWithJen,"I hope they&#39;re happy and will last. I trust him with Jen, he seems wholesome."

GamingWithJen,He seems so nice and genuine and you guys seem to be having so much fun together! I&#39;m glad you are comfortable with sharing a part of your life to us fans. I wish you guys much happiness in these trying times.
GamingWithJen,"I am so glad that you finally introduced your boyfriend to us viewers, so glad that you&#39;re finally happy and with someone that can make you as happy as you seem during the video❤️"
GamingWithJen,Jen: I&#39;ve got a boyfriend!<br>Everyone: Great Job! Happy for you!<br>Pat: I&#39;ve got a girlfriend<br>Everyone: tHe SaCrIfIcIaL lAmB hAs ArRiVeD

GamingWithJen,Jen seems a lot happier now I’m glad her and pat still remain friends :D
GamingWithJen,"I am so happy that Jen has found a new partner and is happy! Ive watched you guys since when i was like 8 and now im 15, so youve been a massive part of my childhood and seeing you happy makes me happy! Sending much love to you! 💜"
GamingWithJen,"Okay, but Jen&#39;s BF is so wholesome, I&#39;m so happy for her, yes I do miss Pat, but Jen seems so genuinely happy! She seems like her old self and nothing had changed!!"
GamingWithJen,I love how pat commented and being supportive its so wholesome.<br>And i hope you guys makes a great couple&lt;3
GamingWithJen,I am so happy for you two and I am happy that pat is able to see eye to eye on this rather than freaking out about it. Let’s hope this works out for you. You seem so happy and that makes me happy.
GamingWithJen,Who else thinks Jen should play Slime Rancher? It just seems like such a good game for her.
GamingWithJen,I&#39;m happy nobody&#39;s hating on her boyfriend. I&#39;d feel awful if people began to hate on him just like people did on Pat&#39;s girlfriend.
GamingWithJen,She sounds so happy!<br>Very glad she&#39;s found another!<br>Sounds like she has another pet too.<br>That&#39;s amazing.<br>Her boyfriend seems supportive and amazing.<br>Love you Jen!💝💝💝💝
GamingWithJen,"Jen: I actually haven’t played this one<br>Also Jen: You wanna be further back, and I’m pretty good at this one actually"
GamingWithJen,"Why is everyone so against Pat?! He did nothing wrong, Pat and Jen are friends and in good terms and pat would never hurt Jen!"
GamingWithJen,Can we talk about how adorable jens character looks?
GamingWithJen,When Andy said “Hey Jen”<br>And Jen laughed it was so genuine that I couldn’t feel sad that my world was breaking apart...<br>Pat and Jen are both happy and we should all know that you can’t force people to be together<br>Edit: currently pat isn’t happy. Just- to yeah y’all probably know by now
GamingWithJen,There’s someone weirder than Jen?<br> I like him already😃❤️
GamingWithJen,"I hope people don&#39;t say anything about jen&#39;s boyfriend now, he is a cool guy"
GamingWithJen,"congrats jen!! we are so happy for you &lt;3 hope you 2 stay safe, healthy &amp; happy :))"
GamingWithJen,Jen: hey guys it’s Jen <br>Andy: hey Jen<br><br>I think this is my new favorite thing 💖💖💖

ItsFunneh,"This was my first roblox game I played, memories :)"
ItsFunneh,"Tip: Stay alone. Other players may bring slender to you without you noticing.<br><br>Tip 2: Never look back. If you look back he may be getting a player behind you.<br><br>Tip 3: Remember some page-hotspot and the next time you go to the same map, go straight to that place and you will have lots of pages by the time you play for a hour."

Sqaishey Quack,This is so chill and enjoyable! Thank you Sqaishey for a good time
Sqaishey Quack,"The lantern on trapdoor thing (and other things) will come in 1.18.30, long time."
Sqaishey Quack,"I just finished watching this video, Sqaishey Quack. I enjoyed this video, so I gave it a like. I look forward to the future episodes. <br><br>I plan to revitalize abandoned villages on Minecraft. I enjoy transforming a deserted village into a thriving village with reinforced walls for protection. 😁 <br><br>P.S. You have a new subscriber. :)"
Sqaishey Quack,This was so much fun! Maybe get some twin/triplet villagers due to the twin/triplet problem of this world XD
Sqaishey Quack,When I Heard squishy say everything spawns in twins I thought of Stampy and squishy’s old series twins!
Sqaishey Quack,Sqaishey you could put name plaques on the buildings to make it really special unlike door numbers.
Sqaishey Quack,"Squaishey I&#39;ve got another challenge for this series if u want to; Get 1 of each villager biomal variant In Village keep (e.g, a savanna villager, a desert villager, an tundra villager (etc,)<br><br>I&#39;d really like to see that I think it&#39;d be really cool for this series!!"

Sqaishey Quack,Same
Sqaishey Quack,2020?
Sqaishey Quack,first viewer yay
Sqaishey Quack,8th viev 3rd comment
Sqaishey Quack,second
Sqaishey Quack,First? Second? What?
Sqaishey Quack,the anxiety i felt seeing them setting off the shrieker knowing a warden could get summoned
Sqaishey Quack,"Setting off the skulk shreaker does cause the warden to spawn if it’s set off 3 times. I think it has to be placed deep under ground, or it’s that only naturally spawned skulk shreakers spawn the warden."
Sqaishey Quack,Some fun ideas to test with the items <br>1. Try wool around the sensors<br>2. Kill something by the thing you thought was vines
Sqaishey Quack,"another way you could do the game to force the shooter to move is if you have another skulk sensor near the player, that has to be constantly set off (maybe it could be connected to redstone that makes it so that the hole you need to shoot through opens when it detects sound), forcing you to make noise and move around while you try to shoot"
Sqaishey Quack,the skulk sensor doesn&#39;t go off if you&#39;re walking on wool so one maybe you could make a sneaking minigame where the floor is made of both wool and concrete powder of the same colour :)
Sqaishey Quack,"Aw man, I only found out about this series when you uploaded the last episode, so I binged all of the episodes from the beginning while I play Minecraft. Now I&#39;m caught up and now I can&#39;t binge anymore 🤣🤣 fantastic series so far 👍 was rewatching sky den until I got curious on what you&#39;ve been up to lately. I don&#39;t regret it, this is great ✨✨"
Sqaishey Quack,Oh no!! Stampy’s caught the skulk bug!! Sending lots of unmouldy potatoes and vegan cookies :) get well soon!! ❤
Sqaishey Quack,"The skulk catalyst spreads skulk when an animal or a player, that drops experience, dies in an 8-block radius of it."
Sqaishey Quack,"I look forward every Wednesday after school so that I can sit and watch my favorite series, I also love watching stampy’s videos !! 💜"
Sqaishey Quack,"I clicked on this video because I haven&#39;t watched you two in a very long time and I just, it is so nostalgic hearing your voices again!"
Sqaishey Quack,For the last tasks on the battle pass you should make stampy carry around a slow animal on a lead for the whole video. Lead breaks=fail. 🤠
Sqaishey Quack,"I think I caught a glimpse of a naturally spawned pink Sheep at like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ8y8updVqM&amp;t=1m45s"">1:45</a>"
Sqaishey Quack,"Oh, yeah, btw, They can&#39;t hear wool or carpet blocks. Wool dampens the sound waves or something so you can place or break wool blocks, and walk and jump on them and the sensor won&#39;t hear you. You can also surround it in wool block to block out sounds from a specific direction if you only want the skulk to pick up noises from one particular direction."
Sqaishey Quack,I love you guys!! Ur vids bring me such joy
Sqaishey Quack,You two make the greatest couple and the greatest YouTubers
Sqaishey Quack,it would be really cool if you built a warden house that looks like an amethyst geode with glass in the front so you can observe your new scary friend
Sqaishey Quack,I use to love watching you but stopped suddenly I may not be you target audience anymore but I can’t wait to hear back to watching you❤
Sqaishey Quack,I love the 2 of you together❤❤
Sqaishey Quack,I had a very bad day and this video cheered me up
Sqaishey Quack,The irony of watching this while I got a cold 😅
Sqaishey Quack,"to anyone scrolling through the comments, I hope you have an amazing day!"
Sqaishey Quack,curiosity killed the cat... or something. There&#39;s a joke here somewhere.
Sqaishey Quack,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ8y8updVqM&amp;t=6m25s"">6:25</a> stampy’s sneeze tho"
Sqaishey Quack,Stampy: were using sckulkyyyy stufff. Haha ty for an amazing moment of laughter and u 2 always make my day
Sqaishey Quack,Stampy/ sqaishey and stampy/ squid are the best duos in YouTube history
Sqaishey Quack,Try to defeat the warden
Sqaishey Quack,the shooty skulky game
Sqaishey Quack,Delicious beaver 54
Sqaishey Quack,stamp sneeze :o
Sqaishey Quack,Calm friend 24
Sqaishey Quack,Hi
Sqaishey Quack,Um that spawns a warden
Sqaishey Quack,I have a feeling this is going to be a very funny series &lt;3
Sqaishey Quack,"Okay but can we just appreciate how comfortable Stampy must be with himself. Many men would refuse to play games with their wives. Especially a game with this much pink and purple. I’ve always admired Stampys love for anything, even if it wouldn’t be considered “masculine”."
Sqaishey Quack,hope you enjoy this weird &amp; wonderful game xD
Sqaishey Quack,I love when they both just start randomly sing “iiiiiiiim gonna swiiiiiing from the chandeliiiiiierrrr!!!”
Sqaishey Quack,‘I’d like to think we made their day.’<br>You always make my day!
Sqaishey Quack,I love how sqaishey is trying to explain without knowing what she’s doing 😂<br>“So um.. we are- we are doing <b>this</b> “ 😂👏
Sqaishey Quack,"Oh my gosh this is so ADORABLE. <br>I know that this is until you can get Cat and a Duck back, but this series could not have come at a better time - as someone currently struggling through finals, this is the perfect thing to watch."
Sqaishey Quack,I love it when you guys play these type of games! It always makes me happy. I am excited to see the next video and view more fun!
Sqaishey Quack,So glad there is a new series! I love when Stampy joins the fun!
Sqaishey Quack,This is so sweet and wholesome I really needed this during finals week thank you
Sqaishey Quack,"Wow! It sure has been a while. Just watching the first minute and I’m so exited to see what this is about! This game looks adorable. I’m so proud of you both, and wanted to say thanks for the good times! I don’t intend to stop watching anytime soon. (Also, squaishy, I’m glad everyone has been so accepting of your new pronouns. Love it!) You’re both such big inspirations to all of us! Thanks so much!!"
Sqaishey Quack,I’d love this to be a series
Sqaishey Quack,This makes me unreasonably happy 😂😂
Sqaishey Quack,this is so enjoyable im so glad it exists. well worth missing duck and a cat (thoguh I enjoy that series very very much)
Sqaishey Quack,"made my day more happier, thank you !!"
Sqaishey Quack,This is so cute! I love these little silly games 🥺
Sqaishey Quack,"Yayyyyyy sausage dog, the perfect holiday present!!!"
Sqaishey Quack,"The name stands for physics dogs. It was originally going to be called dog sports, but the creators decided Phogs was catchier."
Sqaishey Quack,"Oh gosh, this reminds me of the old Catdog cartoon. Man, those were weird times 😂"
Sqaishey Quack,I honestly love watching stampy and squaishey because they always make me so happy and I appreciate that
Sqaishey Quack,I&#39;m so happy for both of you :D
Sqaishey Quack,I love this game! It&#39;s so cute.
Sqaishey Quack,CONGRATS ON 1 MILLION SUBS❤️❤️❤️❤️.  You deserve it 😊😊🌸
Sqaishey Quack,This is just what I needed at this exact moment.
Sqaishey Quack,I can already tell this is gonna be fun xD
Sqaishey Quack,I loved it when both start randomly singing iM gOnNa sWiNG fRoM tHe cHanDeilrlirlir fRom tHe  cHanDerlirlirlirlirlir       I loved it
Sqaishey Quack,Cow and Chicken and CatDog. Now there are some of my childhood shows.
Sqaishey Quack,Loved this video!
Sqaishey Quack,i forgot how much i missed these two
Sqaishey Quack,"I’m a simple person, I see a dog and I click (my pfp may be a cat but I’m more of a dog person)"
Sqaishey Quack,I love this series
Sqaishey Quack,The doggo rp is the best 😂
Sqaishey Quack,I love this series 😁🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sqaishey Quack,Most people in the chat during the stream thought this would be Among us
Sqaishey Quack,"Omg I could watch this all day, this is so funny xDDDDDD"
Sqaishey Quack,Guys I love the new Among Us series! ;)
Sqaishey Quack,I actually follow stamps on Xbox one 🤣 what a dream it would be to play with him
Sqaishey Quack,they are the purest couple i will cry-
Sqaishey Quack,You have now taught me how to play this game 😂😂
Sqaishey Quack,CONGRASTS ON 1MILL SUBS SQAISHEY !
Sqaishey Quack,yayyy a new series!
Sqaishey Quack,"You’re a lot like me when it comes to Redstone, you over complicate it when it’s really simple. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW1JFMbhkfI&amp;t=14m08s"">14:08</a>"
Sqaishey Quack,duu du du Du DU DA
Sqaishey Quack,"Hiiiii sqaishey <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>"
Sqaishey Quack,Claim your “here within an hour ticket here”<br>👇
Sqaishey Quack,I WAS LAUGHING SO HARD WHEN ZIPPER WAS JUST STARING INTO THE FISH EYE LENS
Sqaishey Quack,The helicopter state emoji made me so happy!
Sqaishey Quack,I didn&#39;t get to see much of these streams. But I did see the slime rancher stream from yesterday. But there are apparently no clips from that :(
Sqaishey Quack,I&#39;m American but my voice is more high pichef
Sqaishey Quack,<b>where peas?</b>
Sqaishey Quack,Hi squaishey
Sqaishey Quack,Hewo!
Sqaishey Quack,Hi!
Sqaishey Quack,Hi
Sqaishey Quack,Hi
Sqaishey Quack,"extractors zones: apiary in the moss blanket, drill in the indigo quarry and pump in the dry reef."
Sqaishey Quack,"best slime rancher episode ever, made me laugh sooo much! :]"
Sqaishey Quack,"I feel like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmnVRq5D_og&amp;t=10m22s"">10:22</a> was magic"
Sqaishey Quack,sqaishey when you think you are exploring new areas you should use the echos to guide you back
Sqaishey Quack,yyaaaayyy slime rancher! :)
Sqaishey Quack,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmnVRq5D_og&amp;t=10m21s"">10:21</a> to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmnVRq5D_og&amp;t=10m42s"">10:42</a>  I was laughing at how much that rock tabby largo was launched high in the air"
Sqaishey Quack,The flying rock/tabby made me actually die laughing for some reason
Sqaishey Quack,You could Put some Echos in the cave (at the ranch)
Sqaishey Quack,As soon as you said &quot;Don&#39;t get too upset&quot; I immediatly thought &quot;what happened to the puddle slimes
Sqaishey Quack,Sqaishey you should try putting a pump in the volcano area where the crystal slimes are and see if you get the lava stuff! Like if you agree!
Sqaishey Quack,"The only reason I sleep in the game, is to, get them hungry, to get more ports :)"
Sqaishey Quack,you get deep brine from the dry reef but make sure its the actual dry reef because otherwise you wont get it. LOVE YOUUUUU!
Sqaishey Quack,Sqaishey to help your proplem with the quantum slimes i think  (no evidence just a Theory) If you make the hydro turret in the lab you can use that to eliminate any that turn into tar
Sqaishey Quack,I wish sqaishey read the comments.... If she did she would know to put the pump in the dry reef which isn&#39;t the ranch
Sqaishey Quack,"if you quickly pause the video exactly at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmnVRq5D_og&amp;t=10m21s"">10:21</a> you can see the rock tabby largo. I started cackling when I played it back"
Sqaishey Quack,"The bouncy, tabby, that happens a lot of the time, when they boost each other, your lucky, that he came down by you, and not in the Dry reef xD But It happens, all the time to tabby largos :)"
Sqaishey Quack,Yay I love slime Rancher :)

Sqaishey Quack,"I think it was a slime that spawned from the ground and fired really high, u know how they bounce when they spawn."

Sqaishey Quack,Hey Sqaishey! You are so amazing! You always brighten up my day. I have severe panic attacks and agoraphobia and have not left my house in three years. But when I am having a bad day I always watch your videos with my dog Dixie (our favorite series is Feather Adventures and Super Happy Funtime). Again you are such an amazing person. Lots of love.
Sqaishey Quack,sqaishey I have to admit this is my favourite series! so funny!! :D
Sqaishey Quack,That world cannot be used until you free all four world kings and get enough electoons
Sqaishey Quack,"Sqaishy,the sisters unlock new worlds with levels,the last level has a boss,and that boss is a king...you need to unlock 4 kings,that was why there were 4 worlds unlocked "
Sqaishey Quack,Every island has a boss there&#39;s the jungle with a big spike plant which terns in to a dasey when you defeated it and a chicken that terns into a chicken a dinosaur that terns into a dinosaur and a water dragon that terns into a shrimp this is all right because me and my cousin completed rayman
Sqaishey Quack,you don&#39;t have to pop them you can just let them float away and they die anyways
Sqaishey Quack,Omg i thought i was the only girl that plays ray man origins. PS u have wayyy more had stuff ahead of u sqaishey

Youtuber,Comments
KittyKatGaming,This game is so weird but so fascinating. I can&#39;t wait to see where the story goes next.
KittyKatGaming,"Did they edit Arin sneezing over Suzy&#39;s sneeze, so it didn&#39;t get used on sneeze porn sites, or did Arin bless himself?"
KittyKatGaming,this game is so creepy but i CANT STOP WATCHING
KittyKatGaming,Arin and I said &quot;not anymore&quot; at the same time and with the same cadence and I think it&#39;s time I admit that I watch too much Game Grumps
KittyKatGaming,I am SO intrigued but am trying so hard not to go read the full spoiler-y summary cause I want to experience this in video and WITH Suzy and Arin (cause wiki&#39;s mini summary does state it&#39;s a horror game...)
KittyKatGaming,Can&#39;t wait until episode four. I need more now
KittyKatGaming,Need more!! Love this series
KittyKatGaming,We also call dodgy builders ‘cowboys’ which I think is what they meant!
KittyKatGaming,These 15 minutes go by so fast
KittyKatGaming,It&#39;s funny suzie think&#39;s a cowboy builder is a term for an American and not a builder who cuts corners to get the job done faster/cheaper
KittyKatGaming,I wasn’t the only one that heard that screaming when they turned off the power… Like at one of the last shots I swear there’s screaming…
KittyKatGaming,this series is vaultec approved
KittyKatGaming,They don&#39;t mean Americans when they say cowboys. They mean someone who&#39;s done a real shoddy job.
KittyKatGaming,getting some mad fallout vibes again
KittyKatGaming,Oh man that sneeze jumpscared me 😅
KittyKatGaming,"Would you consider playing Slime Rancher again? Also, this is a really interesting kind of game👌🏼"
KittyKatGaming,All those commodore pet computers 😍
KittyKatGaming,"Cowboy is a phrase we use for a person who cuts corners on a job, not doing it properly, because cowboys are reckless."
KittyKatGaming,Really doesn’t make sense that the radiation with become stronger Or that there would be any to begin with because the government is intelligent enough to have surrounded the entire bunker or make the outer bunker out of lead hooch would keep the radiation from seeping in. But this game is very interesting I would have not gotten it because of the real actors in it because most games like that are poorly made very cheesy.
KittyKatGaming,I bet because you turned the power off SOMETHING escaped from the lower levers... ok let´s find out in the next episode 8D
KittyKatGaming,"wait, i just realised the player character here looks like the guy who played the 12th doctor"
KittyKatGaming,Sneeze porn... its been a long time since I worked at an adult book store. Kinks have evolved
KittyKatGaming,Suzy your fucking awesome
KittyKatGaming,What if level 5 is where the put the bodies?!
KittyKatGaming,ambient sound reminds me of Metal Gear Solid
KittyKatGaming,Application suspending in 15 minutes? Is the game going to delete itself??
KittyKatGaming,I love ghost dot :D
KittyKatGaming,Brilliant
KittyKatGaming,"I think someone can be non-religious, and think suicide is a bad chose. it ain&#39;t over till it&#39;s over."
KittyKatGaming,"When counting seconds, don&#39;t say the number, it has different silaboles as other numbers. (Spellcheck fails me) Instead just say Mississippi and count on your fingers."
KittyKatGaming,GHOST DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT
KittyKatGaming,telling this story as a video game is so weird...you&#39;re not really doing anything...just clicking where they want you to click to make the story progress. would have worked better as a short film or book
KittyKatGaming,The question the reason why they were there
KittyKatGaming,😃😄😅😀
KittyKatGaming,I love you
KittyKatGaming,This game is so boring and linear
KittyKatGaming,"Suzy actually knows what is in each district, and Im just here thinking &quot;Akihabara is the nerdy place,  Ikebukuro is where Durarara takes place, and Shinjuku gets destroyed in multiple anime, most notably Code Geass&quot;"
KittyKatGaming,"gotta compliment on how your voice-acting/reading has improved for this style of game, its fun to listen"
KittyKatGaming,I love how practical this series is.
KittyKatGaming,Looking forward to exploring Japan!
KittyKatGaming,I&#39;m really enjoying this so far; it&#39;s interesting to hear your tidbits of information on things!~
KittyKatGaming,Has Mortem3r ever done like a guide to first time visitors to Japan or a video about her experiences  in Japan?
KittyKatGaming,Highlight of this video was the mental image of Suzy&#39;s eyeroll when she realized what the guy was going on about in the beginning
KittyKatGaming,"&quot;Itadekimasu&quot;, considering how Japanese is, that mispronunciation probably made the word turn into a sexual innuendo."
KittyKatGaming,"I feel like in every game in this style, there is one girl who never wants to hang out with you and always take everything you say the exact opposite of what you actually said"
KittyKatGaming,I like the cool restaurants and those awesome Pokemon characters. Japan sure is a cool place 2 visit!!!!
KittyKatGaming,This really helps me about Japan thank u Mortimer
KittyKatGaming,"I want to go to japan so bad, I am learning Japanese and everything. One of my friends mom is Japanese and they go for during summer every year. They also have the toilet from this episode in their house. Also one question, where did you learn your Japanese? Just Curious."
KittyKatGaming,"admittedly, the toilet part was funny as hell"
KittyKatGaming,"First thing Imma do when I go to Japan, visit the Manga Library"
KittyKatGaming,Ahhh Aki-chan is such a cute tsundere &lt;3
KittyKatGaming,The toilet part made me think of Dan and Phil :3
KittyKatGaming,"This is like the steam train version, but without the jokes"
KittyKatGaming,"I don&#39;t mind the mispronunciation too much, I understand some people just can&#39;t wrap their minds around it. However, the way she&#39;s saying onee-chan is the Japanese word for demon/ogre/etc. XD"
KittyKatGaming,Show us your bathtub already
KittyKatGaming,Can you guess which one is the Tsundere?
KittyKatGaming,"I forgot how much I don&#39;t like this game... Love you still, Suze!"
KittyKatGaming,"Ah, the Tsundere..."
KittyKatGaming,"sucks that you didn&#39;t grab the 3D version, it multiplies the tsun by 20. is gud tho, is gud"
KittyKatGaming,I know this might be a little too late but do you think are you going to play the new version of Honey Pop I really want you to play the whole game even if they have the heart looking like a nice enough but could you play all of it thanks
KittyKatGaming,Akira is the best.
KittyKatGaming,When is there Gonna be more Mgs3
KittyKatGaming,Maximum Over Tsundere!!!
KittyKatGaming,"CONTINUE MGS 3-5 I DONT CARE PLZ CONTINUE THEM From, Jack"
KittyKatGaming,"I can&#39;t stand these still frame games. I hesitate to even call them games, more like index finger exercisers."
KittyKatGaming,"Nice mispronunciation, dont she went to japan like 7 times?"
KittyKatGaming,So glad the Sora route is done with. So uncomfortable.
KittyKatGaming,This game is all sorts of gross.... Also I want to see more.
KittyKatGaming,If there weren&#39;t any nudey pictures Sora&#39;s story would have been two dweebs who crave familiar relationships coming together which isn&#39;t nearly as creepy as the other girls.
KittyKatGaming,I could picture Suzie doing a review channel for prevy games as a joke type deal. Heavy edits to make it Youtube appropriate.
KittyKatGaming,My favorite thing about this game is the puzzle music.  It&#39;s actually pretty catchy/soothing.  :)
KittyKatGaming,Suzy sounds dead inside.
KittyKatGaming,"Lol, I love the little trumpet sound that plays after you open the picture box."
KittyKatGaming,"I am a man of very bizarre fetishes, and this... this is just way too weird."
KittyKatGaming,"Goddamn it plan your move Suzy, you can take a second and look around"
KittyKatGaming,I kinda suspect the makers of the game haven&#39;t met an actual girl before...
KittyKatGaming,That smug smile though
KittyKatGaming,I feel like that cat is judging me every time I look at the nudie pics.
KittyKatGaming,"she&#39;s the least insane, no where near suzu"
KittyKatGaming,Was she calling American dad a family guy knock off?  They&#39;re written by the same guy.  lol
KittyKatGaming,REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE FEELS AHOY!
KittyKatGaming,"Is the gray-ish cat shown throughout the episode actually just black and white and with gray eyes, or was the picture filtered?"
KittyKatGaming,"Honestly if you took the dialogue piece by piece it sounds pretty bad but altogether she was actually a pretty straight up &quot;Little sister image&quot; i found almost none of what she said to be bad, your own lines may have been suggestive at times but few between.."
KittyKatGaming,I know it&#39;s been like this for a while but I really miss the outro
KittyKatGaming,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SArae7-l074&amp;t=7m46s"">7:46</a> that face d0"
KittyKatGaming,"Oh my god! Please drop the symbols on something that matches! I have to fast forward the puzzles cuz&#39; it hurts my soul! Still love you, Suzie XD"
KittyKatGaming,have you thought about playing more scare games on your channel?
KittyKatGaming,"lol, &quot;I&#39;m about to complete....&quot;"
KittyKatGaming,"I know y&#39;all think this character&#39;s voice is cringey/annoying, i personally think it&#39;s fairly cute espacially when it&#39;s in japanese, it kinda grew on me XD"
KittyKatGaming,Nice
KittyKatGaming,you have some chanel I appreciate you 👍
KittyKatGaming,im still subbed!!! 💕
KittyKatGaming,Whyyyyyyy japan whyyyyyyyy!!!! Ahhhhh why this reminds me of why i like kojimas games and capcoms games instead of these dating sims
KittyKatGaming,"this is why i hate modern anime....well,moe to be exact."
KittyKatGaming,i like cheese
KittyKatGaming,203? Good enough for me XD
KittyKatGaming,ok
KittyKatGaming,Why the fuck do you keep calling the narrator-ish girl the <i>House Mom?</i> She looks just as young as any of the students living in the house.
KittyKatGaming,Suzy - “You do have the most coins.”<br>Arin whispers - “because I’m epiiiiic”
KittyKatGaming,"Honestly, I think Arin is going to cheat on Suzy with KittyKatGaming. It&#39;s kinda obvious they have chemistry, hmmm..."
KittyKatGaming,"Suzy really just wants to pet all the characters. First Boo, and now Bowser! Get that girl some plushies!"
KittyKatGaming,I want either Suzy or Arin to win!😊
KittyKatGaming,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWbFnYUhVts&amp;t=5m30s"">5:30</a> - Wait.. Suzy&#39;s got first place in Arin&#39;s heart?<br><br>Does Dan know about this?"
KittyKatGaming,i live in hawaii and i haven&#39;t left the house in days :) but seriously loving this series you guys are always great together!
KittyKatGaming,you and Arin are so cute together ^0^ &lt;3
KittyKatGaming,"I mean, we root for ALL the bad guys now, right? Even Shy Guys and Koopas get some love. We need PomPom to make us appreciate the other characters"
KittyKatGaming,I boot up Mario Party and immediately pick Pom Pom. She’s so cute how could I not?
KittyKatGaming,the two of you together are so <b>wholesome</b>
KittyKatGaming,"My dad owned a company that repaired jets, mostly privately owned ones. He had a few interesting customers like Ron White the comedian, and a Saudi Prince. The interior of the Saudi prince’s plane was full of gold, including the bathroom. Golden sink, golden faucet, golden handles/knobs, and yes, a golden toilet."
KittyKatGaming,Great way to celebrate after clocking out of my first shift at my new job :)
KittyKatGaming,"I am loving this series! Hafta say that you may have confused gender and sex for a moment there, but generally in the right direction!"
KittyKatGaming,&quot;I beat the robots. This is for America!&quot; XD
KittyKatGaming,series is so  cute I love it so far! :3
KittyKatGaming,"When I play Mario Party with my sister she calls Pom Pom, says that&#39;s her spirit animal"
KittyKatGaming,"&quot;No it doesn&#39;t have a desire sensor, that&#39;s Monster Hunter.&quot; <br><br>That&#39;s the biggest truth I&#39;ve ever heard lmfao"
KittyKatGaming,"That bleeding tooth fungus is pretty cool-looking. Then again, I enjoy seeing weird-looking plants."
KittyKatGaming,W h o l e s o m e
KittyKatGaming,I love Bowser he&#39;s my favorite video game character of all time.
KittyKatGaming,&quot;Who boots up Mario party and say dont pick pom pom that my girl&quot;.....Ryan picks Pom pom on game grumps
KittyKatGaming,"My sister plays this game w/ me and is like “Ah fuck, don’t pick Pom Pom that’s my girl!”"
KittyKatGaming,Just for that comment PomPom is going to be my main now
KittyKatGaming,Only Bowser Jr is Bowser&#39;s kid. The others were retconned to be just Bowser&#39;s followers
KittyKatGaming,hes the coin boy hes the one who pays the bills
KittyKatGaming,Iggy is the one with the crazy eyes
KittyKatGaming,i suspect pom pom is plotting to overthrow bowser
KittyKatGaming,Who doesn&#39;t like Toadette? <br>This guy right here
KittyKatGaming,"Arin ;-; you also forgot about Bowser Jr., AKA the best boy"
KittyKatGaming,Daily reminder: Pom Pom is female Boom Boom
KittyKatGaming,(just a friendly reminder that sex does not determine gender! they is a perfectly acceptable singular pronoun)<br><br>Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
KittyKatGaming,&quot;It&#39;s so much more polished than the other ones.&quot;<br>That&#39;s because they focused too much on polish and not enough on content.
KittyKatGaming,"Living in Hawaii is a bit expensive, but everyone&#39;s&#39; always welcome to come."
KittyKatGaming,What about bowser jr.??? Wth!
KittyKatGaming,Suzy growing up as a white kid in Hawaii sucks. A lot of adults don&#39;t like it there either. Not trying to be a Danny Downer just educational.
KittyKatGaming,bowser junior???
KittyKatGaming,Kitty is not a genetic.)
KittyKatGaming,Goals
KittyKatGaming,☺️💜💜💜💜
KittyKatGaming,Ngyaa im gonna do it
KittyKatGaming,Is this enis
KittyKatGaming,"using they to talk about someone specific is such a terrible trend, it&#39;s extreme easy to confuse whether *one&#39;s talking about it in the singular or plural so it&#39;s fairly stupid.<br>One is a pronoun in the English language. It is a gender-neutral, indefinite pronoun, meaning roughly &quot;a person&quot;.<br><br>What do you think of them?<br>They seem nice :)<br>No one has any idea who the f** THEY&#39;re talking about!"
KittyKatGaming,"Your LP for this game is relaxing. I listen to it while I’m playin MHW, lol"
KittyKatGaming,"In order to progress, you need to find the ??? Rathian tracks for a specific kind of Rathian. This will unlock a new hunt to continue with the storyline."
KittyKatGaming,The cats in the food cutscenes are the only reason I play this game with my bf lmao
KittyKatGaming,"Sadly the gajalaka vs palico distinction - gajalakas are also kitties but because they&#39;re tribal and don&#39;t understand your language they&#39;re violent - continues Capcom&#39;s tradition of, uh, &quot;problematic&quot; choices.<br>Still not as bad, since you can make friends with them once you learn their language."
KittyKatGaming,Don&#39;t forget that spirit helm breaker! R2 + Triangle when you have at least one filled spirit gauge level. It does far more damage than spamming Triangle and R2.
KittyKatGaming,"Suzy, you would LOVE Lore Podcast. It’s right up your alley. Folklore and cryptozoology and gruesome history, all told in a very soothing voice."
KittyKatGaming,"&quot;Finally found a Puk-...GOD DAMN IT IT&#39;S HIM. WHERE HAS HE BEEN&quot; Hahahaha, Probably right there? Love you suzy, never change.<br>I wonder if Suzy will realize you can move around while on the back of the monster? Some weapons will attack while you move too, I use Insect Glaive and I do an attack that does decent damage every time I move from the head to the back, or the back to the tail. :)"
KittyKatGaming,The Hot Zone is a really good documentary style book. It&#39;s the &quot;accurate and scientific&quot; retelling of the emergence of ebola virus and it&#39;s really informative but also easy and enjoyable to read. It reads as a documentary crossed with a thriller would in movie form
KittyKatGaming,"Whenever you do a quest, the monster will be in there in. In that one episode where the rathian left, you had to have just been on an expedition, and there’s no way it would be a rathalos hunt in disguise."
KittyKatGaming,One of the weirder things about that Russian mystery is that the articles of clothes were found somewhat radioactive.
KittyKatGaming,Keep up the videos! I am enjoying the series.  I am still new to the game but I believe where you killed him is his actual nest. I have hunted him a couple of times already trying to get the armor and he is usually there or around there. I have yet to find the Kitty village though.
KittyKatGaming,Suzy.<br>Show us your Hunters room please~
KittyKatGaming,"&quot;Where has he been this entire match?!&quot; Right where you found him. That&#39;s primarily where he hangs out, that one area of the map you didn&#39;t go it."
KittyKatGaming,"Camping is a good experience to have even if you have mixed feelings on liking it or not, so that way you have at least hands on practice just in case you ever need to camp out one day."
KittyKatGaming,"I was a Boy Scout in my younger years, camping is very fun and relaxing.  If you&#39;re the type that enjoys not having a schedule or being fine with just going with the flow camping might be for you.  I really enjoyed just walking around listless with nothing on my mind. It does get cooler at night, so I recommend camping near the beginning or end of summer."
KittyKatGaming,Also book wise I just got done with Troublemaker by Leah Remini. It was a very interesting and eyeopening autobiography.
KittyKatGaming,"The necessary things for camping are a tent, a tarp to put under the tent, something to sleep on (air mattress, cot, or foam mat), blankets (or sleeping bag), food, and water. <br><br>If it is hot get a battery powered fan and let air flow through the tent (some tents have bug net windows others you may need to open or remove the rain fly[water proof tent topper]). If you want a fire bring a lighter, start with small toothpick sized twigs and work your way up to logs. I would avoid burning leaves because embers can rise and possibly catch trees on fire.<br><br>If there are bears in the area of the campsite, put all food, dishes, hygiene products, trash, (water bottles if it has been used for any drinks other than water in the past 2 years), and any other scented products in a bear locker or in a bag suspended high above the ground (throw a rope over a high branch and hoist it up)."
KittyKatGaming,"If you like Fiction/Fantasy, the Kushiel Legacy by Jacqueline Cary is amazing! It starts at Kushiel&#39;s Dart. She basically fantasizes ancient france and when she starts to travel there&#39;s so much based in ancient lore you will learn something. Her other book series Agent of Hel is based on greek mythologybut set in Michigan, and then there&#39;s MIranda and Caliban based on the old novel &quot;The Tempest.&quot; But if none of those sound awesome and you like musicals &quot;The Real Story of Maria VOn Trapp&quot; is really interesting as well as &quot;Maus&quot;."
KittyKatGaming,I have a question! When are you going to start doing streams of mhw or play with your fan’s? Get them involved with your video’s hunting with others can be a lot of fun as you already showed. When you huntby yourself the video isn’t as interesting but it looks like and sounds like your having fun when you hunt with others.
KittyKatGaming,"Another reason for them being found underdressed is called (if memory serves) paradoxical undressing, seen in circumstances with extremely low temperatures if what I read was accurate. Its been a few years since I read it but I vaguely remember it saying that in the event of hypothermia your blood rushes from the extremities to the chest cavity as like a last ditch attempt to keep the organs functioning. Anyway a somewhat more enjoyable read (for me at least) was the Shadows of the Apt series. Its sort of a fantasy series where each &quot;race&quot; has a unique set of skills, like the Ant-Kinden can communicate mind to mind so they are great soldiers. Mantis-kinden are warriors, spiders are manipulators etc etc. Anyway its not for anyone, but its good mind-food for the dreamers amongst us Kitty Kat [="
KittyKatGaming,"If you want to start camping I would recommend researching camp sites nearby, some have showers and small cabins you can rent. If you want to go any further reserve a spot at one of those camp sites, borrow a tent, bring food you can cook by the fire (some places have small metal stove you can use as well as wood to buy),  borrow two sleeping bags, long matches, and a tarp (to keep your tent off wet ground).  If you don&#39;t like the experience you can leave early, the fee to reserve space for one or two nights isn&#39;t that expensive. Also AC is overrated on a nice fall weekend however, I live near-ish to the Appalachian trail and have no idea what LA weather is like. I&#39;m sure there are also better local guides online for camping then this YouTube comment."
KittyKatGaming,You shouldnt have skipped all the tutorials
KittyKatGaming,"You don&#39;t need much to go camping. All you&#39;d need for minimum camping trip would be a flashlight, a lighter or matches, maybe a cooler to keep food and drinks, a tarp to keep rain off you, and a sleeping bag. Just ask someone who&#39;s camped before to help. Camping with friends is great!"
KittyKatGaming,"If you want creature comforts while &quot;camping&quot; KOA campgrounds are a thing. but if you want to actually go out in the wilderness and camp then you don&#39;t need lanterns or fire starting kit or a ton of stuff. Sleeping bags to be comfy, and something to start fire obviously but matches or lighters work. You can sleep under the stars or buy a tent(depends where you are). Past that bring a cooler of food and drink and have a plan for what to do with your day. Like fish or nature walk or read or something."
KittyKatGaming,you know the times are changing when for some people its expensive to go camping. yes. technically it is if you go out and buy everything youd wanna camp with for one trip. but damn. ive been camping for weeks on end i just kinda of assumed it was something everyone knows.
KittyKatGaming,Tough Shit by Kevin Smith has always been a favorite of mine but One Who Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest narrated by John C Riley is a great listen from Audible.
KittyKatGaming,Rent a camper! Its about big enough for two people so you and Arin should be snug as lil bugs!!
KittyKatGaming,I really recommend the “and that’s why we drink” it’s a paranormal and supernatural podcast
KittyKatGaming,"I&#39;m reading the Evolving Self by Mihaly Csikszentmihaly. Kind of self-help, more on advancing ones consciousness. Also I recommended OverDrive, it&#39;s an app that lets you rent library audiobooks for free!"
KittyKatGaming,"&#39;Last chance to see&#39; Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine travel the world and look for endangered animals. Its from 1990, the story of how it came to be and the trip is very entertaining. Adams tells part of the story in a speech at UCSB, on video here on youtube called &#39;Parrots, the universe and everything&#39;."
KittyKatGaming,"I would suggest going camping with a company that supplies all the equipment. The one I used is called Wildland Trekking. I went to the Grand Canyon and they were great! The guide took care of the food, explained what all the equipment was and had a ton of knowledge about the canyon. They have tours in Death Valley so you could look at the different camping/hiking options they have or see if there is another company that does something similar closer to where you are. That way, you could get advice from someone that camps all the time and see if it&#39;s something you&#39;d ever want to do again before investing in equipment."
KittyKatGaming,An interesting book that I haven&#39;t read yet but have heard good things about is Quiet: The power of introverts.
KittyKatGaming,i mean if you have fun learning then you could say you are reading for fun even if you&#39;re not reading a story with a plot and everything
KittyKatGaming,The autobiography on Malcom x is pretty good.
KittyKatGaming,omg you should read the book cryers cross its extemely good and has an amazing twist
KittyKatGaming,"Honestly if you just want to go enjoy nature, and you&#39;re concerned about discomfort, you should just rent a little cabin for a few days. Most rental cabins will have all the fire-starting stuff to do things like make smores and you can get one with at least an AC unit if it&#39;s crazy hot when you go.<br>If you rent a cabin up in Mt Lassen National Park, though, it probably won&#39;t be that hot. The elevation keeps it pretty cool year-round.<br>Lamps and sleeping bags are good to have in your house for power outages and couch-surfing friends, and firestarters are like five or ten bucks. The real expense of camping is a tent, and if you don&#39;t study up on how and where to pitch it it&#39;ll be really uncomfortable even if you get a nice one. So yeah: Cabin."
KittyKatGaming,On camping:  first go with someone who knows what they are doing and has a spare tent and sleeping bag for you so you dont have to buy your own.<br><br>On the russians: There&#39;s a game about that called Kholat or something... markiplier played it like last year or 2016.  <br><br>On audio books:  You may want to try Atlas Shrugged.  Its not really a non-fiction book but you will learn a lot in a roundabout sort of way.  For a more direct learning experience there&#39;s also liberal fascism by jonah goldberg.
KittyKatGaming,"The Name of the Wind, by Patrick Rothfuss.<br><br>Though based on the books you named, I can&#39;t guarantee that it will be to you liking."
KittyKatGaming,"It doesn&#39;t defeat the purpose of camping. Different people have different purposes for camping. Experiencing the scenery, but not the hardship, is a completely valid purpose."
KittyKatGaming,"Suzyyyy, you can roll out of using items! D:"
KittyKatGaming,I think markiplier played an indie game based off of the Death Mountain story
KittyKatGaming,"school ruined reading for me but my three top books ill never forget are maniac mcgee, code orange, and Fiend"
KittyKatGaming,i cant believe u threw away your potions for latchberrys aka bowgun ammo
KittyKatGaming,"Audible has &quot;Batman and Psychology&quot; by various authors, &quot;Paddle Your Own Canoe&quot;, &quot;Gumption: Relighting the Torch of Freedom with America&#39;s Gutsiest Troublemakers&quot; and &quot;Good Clean Fun&quot; by Nick Offerman."
KittyKatGaming,camping is so fun just make sure you have camping gear
KittyKatGaming,"There is a documentary on YouTube by a channel called LEMMiNO that offers a much more reasonable explanation for the Russian camp mystery than what that book gave, and it doesn’t require as many logic leaps."
KittyKatGaming,Finally! Kitties!!!!
KittyKatGaming,"Snipers are OP in this mode, lot of nice, slow floating targets to turkey shoot."
KittyKatGaming,"I love watching you play Overwatch Suzy, keep it up! 💕"
KittyKatGaming,"I like how you suggest an ideal comp for an arcade mode....... zero gravity no less<br><br>also sombras good the way she is, a little buff may be necissary but her ultimate is perfect, it&#39;s the team that needs buffing if they can&#39;t follow through with the emp.<br><br>no hate though I still love your channel"
KittyKatGaming,"Considering everyone&#39;s falling very, very, v e r y slowly, I&#39;d say it&#39;s no surprise why the snipers do so well in this mode."
KittyKatGaming,"Tbh, I&#39;m glad that you, as a way higher ranked Mercy player, also have moments when you res 1 person instead of more on accident. Pubbies can be pretty mean/bossy towards Mercy players imo so this is a nice lil self-esteem boost to see you play :,)<br>I love your videos! Thanks a bunch for making them!"
KittyKatGaming,"&quot;im so stoned and this is fucking amazing&quot; @ <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZQt0pHyIJU&amp;t=8m41s"">8:41</a><br>gotta love ow chats"
KittyKatGaming,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZQt0pHyIJU&amp;t=0m40s"">0:40</a> Optimism, Suzy! It feels way better to turn the tide of a Losing game then win every game with ease."
KittyKatGaming,"Sombra already has potential to replace even the second support slot. Her value is all about team coordination though. A good Sombra can&#39;t do anything if the team don&#39;t react to the benefits she provides (like prioritizing hacked health packs, hacked targets and initiating when EMP is ready). Without coordination the healer of the team can easily steal Sombra&#39;s ult-charge as well but the biggest problem is the huge lack of communication.<br><br>Edit: Oh, and I&#39;m all for more OW-vids. I think the best ones have been the videos where you are doing fun and ridiculous things for the sake of fun as a group. It&#39;s also fun to see variety of heroes and listening opinions about everything related to Overwatch instead of always just talking about what is happening during the match. That&#39;s why event-unboxings have always been neat."
KittyKatGaming,All the viewers want is a steady diet of OW and Stay! Stay! with Arin.
KittyKatGaming,I was playing with some friends the other day on Overwatch. I was playing Pharah on the low gravity Mao we were on. I had a hard time landing with her but it was fun. Our team did win the match.
KittyKatGaming,"So the 3 characters I&#39;ve seem that do well in low gravity are tracer, genji and hanzo. Both genji and tracer get way more movement freedom with Genji&#39;s double jump and tracers blink. While Hanzo gets clearer shots since almost everyone, while junking is moving slower. Making for better targets. Though that might be for snipers in general."
KittyKatGaming,The only bad thing about this game mode are the people who go super tryhard mode and pick Widowmaker and snipe the slow moving aerial targets like the &quot;pros&quot; they are.
KittyKatGaming,I think a nice episode of Overwatch would be offering your best tips for certain heros.
KittyKatGaming,It&#39;d be cool to see you play some 1v1s that are available in the arcade!
KittyKatGaming,"As much as I love watching overwatch videos, more Stay Stay would be great"
KittyKatGaming,"Wow, if there&#39;s zero gravity then the magnetic field must be intense here."
KittyKatGaming,&quot;Stupid fuckin&#39; sniper&quot; &quot;This hanso can&#39;t shoot for shit&quot; love when real gamer Suzy slips out lol
KittyKatGaming,"Reaper doesn&#39;t heal his team with his ult, he just has 20% life steal on all damage he deals instead of needing to collect orbs."
KittyKatGaming,"Always open to OW play Suzy, you just play whatever you want.<br><br>Though, I do hope you play Dream Daddy when that comes out officially."
KittyKatGaming,Payday in Hollywood in this mode is insane.  I love this mode.
KittyKatGaming,POTG is Suze getting pwned. That&#39;s hilarious.
KittyKatGaming,"hey suzy :) I love watching you play overwatch but I also miss night in the woods and kirby&#39;s epic yarn, could you bring those back? love you!"
KittyKatGaming,So bra doesn&#39;t need a buff in fact she seems to me to be one of the most powerful characters it how you use her that matters
KittyKatGaming,I think the tracer line was a joke about her invisibility
KittyKatGaming,Are you going to play the Dad Simulator when it comes out or would that be too weird? Would it be hilarious if like....Danny voiced over arin&#39;s parts....lmfao
KittyKatGaming,Longr Hino. Suzy. You are the best. Sounds like something I would say hahahaha.
KittyKatGaming,You died in the POTG but got an end card. Double feature.
KittyKatGaming,"this would be low gravity, otherwise you wouldnt fall down....but eh, pretty colors!"
KittyKatGaming,Can we have the exciting episode of Stay! Stay!?
KittyKatGaming,Dr. Suzy is on the job!🏩🚑
KittyKatGaming,"if there truly was zero gravity, the air would have no reason to stay in the atmosphere"
KittyKatGaming,I love you!Cant wait to watch!
KittyKatGaming,I&#39;m literally begging for a friend invite into some Overwatch with you.
KittyKatGaming,Gengi is good on this mode
KittyKatGaming,legit ow is the best on this channel
KittyKatGaming,You just never had a Sombra on your team cause those aren&#39;t new Suzy
KittyKatGaming,You should try some Mystery Heroes !
KittyKatGaming,I love overwatch toooo pls keep playing itt!! 💖💖💖💖
KittyKatGaming,"Why&#39;s everyone (bye everyone I mean the characters in the game, not the players) so mean to sombra?!"
KittyKatGaming,how can there so much cute in just one intro
KittyKatGaming,Damn Suzy so salty
KittyKatGaming,you should play as my girl D.Va or a ProGenji lol
KittyKatGaming,lets see headshot only widow in custom
KittyKatGaming,I dont think you actually understand how the reaper buff works xD
KittyKatGaming,"That&#39;s not zero gravity, it&#39;s low gravity"
KittyKatGaming,i love your vids so much one of my fav youtubers
KittyKatGaming,I just saw the introduction for the first time and I&#39;m scared
KittyKatGaming,I love your channel but...  Where is Stay! Stay!???
KittyKatGaming,STAY STAY!
KittyKatGaming,"I want you guys to bring hunting monsters back... Damn.. it had everything... quality content,  great multiplayer banter, and awesome intro... please bring it back... ROOOOOSSSSSS!!!"
KittyKatGaming,You have no idea how excited I am you&#39;re playing Monster Hunter again
KittyKatGaming,fingers crossed for another &quot;hunting monster&quot; series
KittyKatGaming,"Suzy, they changed how Armor Skills work now. They each give points towards seperate skills. You can mix and match for different skills. Try to look up some info, since its drastically changed in World."
KittyKatGaming,well looks who is back playing MH hope you enjoyed the beta! happy hunting
KittyKatGaming,I&#39;m soooo excited for this game. I&#39;d love to see more of the beta please!
KittyKatGaming,"Would love to see you do the other two, and hopefully a full series when the game comes out."
KittyKatGaming,"Monster Hunter is the reason why I started watching your channel! So excited to see it back, can’t wait for the full game when it comes out."
KittyKatGaming,My favorite was the white cat that looks like a mouse. <br><br>You should have a massive grump crew monster hunt
KittyKatGaming,"Please do more with Monster Hunter World, i absolutely love seeing you cover the series"
KittyKatGaming,Yes! I am so glad to see you playing MonHun again! I hope you&#39;ll do a Let&#39;s Play of the full game. I&#39;d love to see you play more.
KittyKatGaming,Yes super excited for this game!!! Will the Grumps be playing the game with fans!?
KittyKatGaming,I am excited to see another MH series here!
KittyKatGaming,They keep making the palicos so much more darn cute every time .
KittyKatGaming,I love the Insect Glaive. But I think once the game comes out I’m gonna go with either the gunlance or the heavy bowgun.
KittyKatGaming,This game looks so beautiful!!!
KittyKatGaming,Please do more videos for this game!! I’ve waited forever too see gameplay of it.
KittyKatGaming,I didn&#39;t realise this series was so cute!<br><br>Well looks like that&#39;s one more pre-order for me haha<br><br>-Voldsea
KittyKatGaming,I always want to see more monster hunter from you. More please!!
KittyKatGaming,"Wait Suzy are you super excited? Lol looking forward to a new monster Hunter playthrough, they are always so good!"
KittyKatGaming,hey suz I dig this please do the others!
KittyKatGaming,Ah man this looks pretty rad! Not as goofy as the original series but at least you still get your palico! <br>Bring back Hunting Monsters!!!
KittyKatGaming,Also the Scout Flies are that green mist that targets things in the world for you to investigate :)
KittyKatGaming,seeing the other difficulties would be nice and maybe will show off the other tools in action
KittyKatGaming,I randomly saw this review and I was like I don&#39;t know who this MH player was so I clicked it. As it started and I heard her voice I was like that sounds so much like Suzy...*goes and searches the webs finds out its Suzys third channel I never knew existed* well damn
KittyKatGaming,it is a little tricky to pick out the scout flies in bright areas like this
KittyKatGaming,"Kinda glad this has come back to its playstation roots, I find it so much easier to play with a proper controller instead of weird pads or a tiny little handheld like the 3DS, felt amazing to play this with a couple of friends on PS4~&lt;3"
KittyKatGaming,"I was curious to see if Suzy finally hit more buttons than just X (3DS), and I&#39;m so happy she&#39;s improving."
KittyKatGaming,"That&#39;s it. I&#39;m going back to Monster Hunter... I&#39;ve never had friends to play with, but it&#39;s still such a GREAT game. Much love Capcom &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3"
KittyKatGaming,im a long time monster hunter champion played it since the first one on ps2 love love love mohun favorite game of all time i would love to see a series of this when it comes out also monster hunter doesnt randomly throw things together for monsters its actually really cool they base them off of alot of things movie monsters ancient mythical beasts and gods and real life animals mixxed with their own custom style its awesome im getting it for ps4 and pc pc for all my friends and ps4 to play solo
KittyKatGaming,There is a full cinematic story campaign for the first time in the series because it&#39;s on home consoles.<br><br>You will be able to play the story through all ranks including high rank. MH4 let you play a story until low rank ended so they have changed it and made a more meaty story to appeal more to a Western audience.
KittyKatGaming,You should do more!
KittyKatGaming,"Oh man, I haven&#39;t played an MH game since &#39;Freedom 2&#39; on the PSP. I&#39;m really excited to get back in."
KittyKatGaming,Do a full playthrough pls
KittyKatGaming,That victory song that played when she killed the Jaggra sounded kind of like something from FFXIII
KittyKatGaming,More please :)
KittyKatGaming,If I was in this world I would be a complete danger to myself because I would try to befriend all the monsters no matter how dangerous they were. 😆
KittyKatGaming,More monster hunter world please!
KittyKatGaming,I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re playing tbis
KittyKatGaming,This looks like it is my ideal game. Too bad I can&#39;t get it since it isn&#39;t coming to the Switch
KittyKatGaming,Cute that Suzy thinks she started this channel 4-5 years ago when it&#39;s only been like 2. :P
KittyKatGaming,"Great Jagras may be a Fanged Wyvern, but it looks too much like a real iguana to take seriously."
KittyKatGaming,"Huntiiiing Monsterrrrrrrs! Yes do the baroth, please"
KittyKatGaming,"Awww yeah, we&#39;re back with some MonHun again! Wooooo!"
KittyKatGaming,"STAND UP &amp; RUN, Mortimer! You only have 20 minutes!"
KittyKatGaming,"Btw,you mentioned that people usually just make mouth noises instead of English,that&#39;s a setting you can change,it&#39;s Monster Hunter language"
KittyKatGaming,&quot;You&#39;re Taxi-King in my heart!&quot;<br>And then Arin&#39;s smile. Jesus christ you guys are adorable. A real life OTP!
KittyKatGaming,I&#39;m really glad Suzy has her own gaming channel. It&#39;s good to see more &quot;Gamer Girls&quot; who are really awesome and funny on YouTube.
KittyKatGaming,"&quot;Cut the skip-scene.&quot;<br>Lawd Suzy, you&#39;ve just coined something beautiful."
KittyKatGaming,&quot;You&#39;re Taxi King in my heart. 💖&quot; <br>There goes my daily dose of cuteness for today ;; ~
KittyKatGaming,&quot;We have a special guest: Egoraptor! From Game Grumps.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m your husband.&quot;<br><br>LOL
KittyKatGaming,Everything in this video is super cute. It&#39;s great that we get KKG for facecam
KittyKatGaming,I can&#39;t get enough of these two playing games together.
KittyKatGaming,"About the cow mutilations. It&#39;s flies. More specifically, maggots. The soft tissues, such as the utter and lips (as mentioned by Suzy) decay and are eaten by the maggots. As for the &quot;surgical precision&quot; cuts, the cow&#39;s rotting carcass decays and gasses get trapped in the bodies. The gasses cause it to swell, and eventually the hide rips.<br><br>If there was a surgeon or even something intelligent cutting on the cows, all the cuts would be the same. Like at a coroner&#39;s morgue. But they&#39;re not. If Aliens are visiting Earth, they didn&#39;t master interstellar space travel just to take home some cow lips."
KittyKatGaming,"Every time I have to wait a few days between episodes, I can feel myself going through withdrawal :p I&#39;m so glad for another episode!"
KittyKatGaming,Dat contrast between Arin&#39;s deliberate non-cussing and Suzy&#39;s F bombs tho.
KittyKatGaming,It&#39;s always so cute seeing Arin and Suzy together!
KittyKatGaming,"I appreciate how when Arin starts yelling, Suzy starts trying to keep him quiet. It&#39;s good."
KittyKatGaming,"Your videos are so relaxing. I think I enjoy watching them too much, but not in a bad case. I&#39;m glad that this episode came out right when I needed to go to sleep. All of the life&#39;s bullshit is completely gone."
KittyKatGaming,"Can these two get any cuter!? Ugh, I love KKG!"
KittyKatGaming,&quot;I&#39;m your husband...&quot; That was the cutest thing! You two are amaze
KittyKatGaming,&quot;I&#39;m your husband.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br>That cracked me up! 
KittyKatGaming,"Eeerrrggghhh... you two are too cute together... makes my lonely, embittered heart cry feel tears."
KittyKatGaming,Aliens are one of my biggest fears so you&#39;re not alone Suzy
KittyKatGaming,I&#39;m so glad you updated! You guys are super cute together :)<br>
KittyKatGaming,Aw yeah! Lovin&#39; the episode fun!
KittyKatGaming,"Oh no, Pirates might be up next! It&#39;d be hilarious watching them play it although utilizing the facecam while playing that minigame is definitely going to be tricky for them. That is, if they&#39;re really planning to go through with this."
KittyKatGaming,"It doesn&#39;t happen now, but when I was younger, aliens scared the SHIT out of me. I would start getting anxiety attacks and tears just from people talking about them"
KittyKatGaming,Ah Arin is doing the alien bit Larry Wilmore did ah love it.
KittyKatGaming,"man... you really sold me on this game! first that Island minigame or what it&#39;s called and now these cool little minigames... Game &amp; Wario seems really cool, I always thought it looked really boring but jow... I might pick it up!"
KittyKatGaming,"Love these videos! Wish you would play some more Monster Hunter, it&#39;s so fun to see you play that one, even just when you play on your own."
KittyKatGaming,"With Waffle and Mr. Blik giving taxi rides to cows, they ended up getting their customers abducted by aliens from outta the blue. However, these two jitty kats managed to stop them and got their pay for giving them a ride to their barn. What challenge awaits our Kat Herds face next?"
KittyKatGaming,I love you and Arin.
KittyKatGaming,Gotta save the cows for dem Baby Bell cheese rounds
KittyKatGaming,Another great video
KittyKatGaming,Cut the skip scene nice one suzy :)
KittyKatGaming,"Glad you have further finalized the format of this show, Mort3mer (feels like guest grumps everyday!)  In case you are doing it unnaturally (or it feels compulsory), you don&#39;t have to saying &quot;fucking&quot; to be funny.  If you are being yourself, disregard the previous statement.  Proud of y&#39;all!"
KittyKatGaming,"Actually Suzie, the whole &#39;surgical precision&#39; thing involving dead cattle was proven to be basic scavenging behavior. I can&#39;t remember what the exact explanation for the cauterization was but it was something to do with people examining these corpses not knowing what they&#39;re looking at. Not that I&#39;m trying to misdirect you in an effort to cover anything up, HAHAHAHA... 0_0"
KittyKatGaming,"JUST watched part 2, thanks!"
KittyKatGaming,&quot;I&#39;m your husband&quot; I ship these guys so hard. They&#39;re stupidly cute. :)
KittyKatGaming,"I was eating a Babybell cheese round right when you said that! Oh man, crazy town."
KittyKatGaming,KKG! KKG! YEAAAAA! <br>I like how cat Ross is the biggest grump of them all XD
KittyKatGaming,I love this so much &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
KittyKatGaming,Suzy talking about aliens<br>Ayyy
KittyKatGaming,"Suzy, if you ever want to make a challenge video, I suggest trying to put on your make up while also playing a game. Markiplier did this in an older video and it was pretty hilarious. Think about it!"
KittyKatGaming,&quot;cut the skipscene&quot;remembering that one haha :D
KittyKatGaming,"There are many good skeptical analyses of cattle mutilation. The scalpel-like cut marks are the result of bloating and rupturing, typical of decomposition. The loss of eyes, anus etc can be attributed to desiccation (thing like anuses and udders shrivel as an animal decomposes) and also scavengers (tongues and eyes are often the first things to be eaten by coyotes, crows etc). Lack of blood is attributed to blood pooling close to the ground due to gravity (no circulation, so the blood goes to the parts close to the ground)."
KittyKatGaming,I just wish there was some way to record the wiiU game pad
KittyKatGaming,"And btw, new &quot;outro&quot; picture looks great"
KittyKatGaming,I WANT A GAMEGRUMPS FACE CAM
KittyKatGaming,"You two are great, but it sucks that we cannot see what happend on the wii u gamepad because this time it was boring whats going on on the television."
KittyKatGaming,"You gaiz, stahp. With the cuteness and the loving each other and the such. Eez too much. My heart cannot even.<br><br>Also, your outro music is really cool but like...really mismatched with everything else about your channel. Cute, cartoony intro...you&#39;ve thus far played cute games, with awesome friends and loved ones as guest stars...and the outro music is like, creepy and unsettling."
KittyKatGaming,I don&#39;t mind the skipscenes.
KittyKatGaming,&quot;We&#39;ll eat eat each other&#39;s lips.&quot; If you know what I mean
KittyKatGaming,nice pokemon colisseum reference!
KittyKatGaming,Suzy is too nice for this game lol
KittyKatGaming,I enjoyed this episode so much that I Screamed and then subsequently Creamed.
KittyKatGaming,Don&#39;t talk to me in the morning until I&#39;ve had my Scream and Cream
KittyKatGaming,When you&#39;ve realized Matt&#39;s been hanging around Oney too much.
KittyKatGaming,I&#39;m disappointed Barry didn&#39;t write &quot;Women&#39;s Surfrage&quot;.
KittyKatGaming,I love the jackbox series. I hope the fans get to play along again one day.
KittyKatGaming,"Aw, I love Suzy&#39;s laugh in this episode!"
KittyKatGaming,I want a Scream N&#39; Cream t-shirt with a penguin on it!
KittyKatGaming,"You really ought to livestream this game sometime, like you did with Trivia Murder Party. It&#39;s way more fun when you&#39;ve got a full room and a big audience."
KittyKatGaming,When you&#39;re watching a horror movie and there&#39;s a jumpscare but you&#39;re sexually attracted to monsters<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>Scream n&#39; cream!
KittyKatGaming,Loving all the Jackbox videos &lt;3
KittyKatGaming,We have a member of our regular Cards Against Humanity circle who is now forever known as Hot Cheese due to a legendary hand of said game. I suspect after this we may have a permanent Matt &quot;Scream n Cream&quot; Watson situation going on.
KittyKatGaming,I would love to see this with everybody in it.
KittyKatGaming,"Two years later, and I still scream and cream."
KittyKatGaming,I&#39;m now including scream n cream into my everyday vocabulary
KittyKatGaming,"I feel like scream and cream should be something that happens when you try to talk to your crush but then fail, similar to crying and shitting, but a little more awkward."
KittyKatGaming,One round is not enough Quiplash for a video! More!
KittyKatGaming,"I love the Jackbox episodes! <br>Also, Scream N Cream!"
KittyKatGaming,Wow matt really does like his dad. No wonder he made that song about him.
