Infinite Earth has a quick cooldown. In fact, it has the same exact duration and cooldown as Amplify, so they can both be used together very quickly, and, as he already noticed, to great effect. Just put down more earth than the waves can push back against. That&#39;s what I did with this map. Also, the totems/villages were the highest points on my run on this map.

Museum Outpost and the center Safezone are safest and easiest to reach<br>4. Players cannot kill or shoot guns in the safezones¬†<br>5. Don&#39;t buy anything but ammunition for guns, everything else is easy to scavenge<br>6. Avoid water/puddles, it&#39;s loud and alerts players/nether easily.¬†<br>7. If you get &quot;stuck&quot; on a ledge or something, switch to crouch or crawl and it will unstick you. It&#39;s a small bug i hope they fix soon.<br>8.

Markiplier,"Hello everybody! My name is Markiplier, and welcome to Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s: an indie horror game that you guys suggested en masse, and I saw that Yamimash played it, and he said it was really really good. So I&#39;m very eager to see what is up. And that is a terrifying animatronic bear! &quot;Family pizzeria looking for security guard to work the nightshift.&quot; Oh... &quot;12 am: the first night.&quot; If I didn&#39;t wanna stay the first night, why would I stay any more than... five...? Why would I stay any more than two‚Äîhello. Ok... Hello? Hello? Oh‚Äîoh, I can&#39;t move. That&#39;s a creepy skull. There&#39;s creepy things on the wall. Oh, hello. Hi! Hi!

I thought it was weird that I couldn&#39;t move. But this is totally different‚Ä¶ than any horror game I&#39;ve ever played. So what you&#39;ve gotta do, in case you&#39;re not getting it, is you&#39;ve gotta watch‚Ä¶ the cameras to make sure‚Ä¶ they don&#39;t come by, and you&#39;ve only got a little much power!

But he&#39;s really awesome at this kind of stuff and he creates my type of horror. Jumpscares just annoy me, when some one makes something that&#39;s horror and it fills you with nothing but dread and anxiety then you&#39;ve done horror right if you ask me.<br><br>Everyone should go watch &quot;If P.T. was made in 1998&quot; you wont be sorry,",2018-11-11T03:58:01Z

jacksepticeye,"To jacksepticeye: The game Saurian is supposed to give you an up-to-date simulation of what life was like in Hell Creek, a geological formation in what is now Montana, North and South Dakota, and Wyoming. It is famous for it&#39;s amazingly preserved fossil record that gave us an almost perfect picture of what life was like in North America 66-65 million years ago, before the KPG mass extinction. Every detail, right down to the plants in the game and how the animals behave, is based on what paleontologists know from the fossil record and how regular animals behave today.¬†<br><br>The animal you played as was not a Utahraptor, it was a Dakotaraptor. Utahraptor lived 125 million years ago, 60 million years earlier than Dakotaraptor, and was much bigger. Utahraptor was about 23ft long and less than 500 kilograms, about as big as a polar bear, while Dakotaraptor was 18ft long and about as big as the fake raptors of Jurassic Park. And while Dakotaraptor was built in the same was as most dromaeosaurs, Utahraptor was more robust and built less for speed and more for taking down large tough prey.",2017-08-16T01:48:58Z

DanTDM,Emeralds are at mid. Put your stuff you don&#39;t need for now in the chest. Kill a bed to get access to their normal chest. It&#39;s best to build a thick layer of obi and ends tone for the dragons if you get that far. The dragons can now destroy any block so build multiple layers. Stock up on emeralds for obi. Buy a bow to kill the dragons.,2017-07-01T01:59:21Z
DanTDM,Dan: &quot;The arrows are so bugged! I could&#39;ve killed him!&quot;<br><br>Me: 8sigh* Keep saying it Dan. Keep saying it and it might come true.,2018-03-11T01:22:47Z

DanTDM,i think it&#39;s nice of him that he gives himself a nickname so fans don&#39;t let him win,2017-07-02T16:07:07Z
DanTDM,Hey dan the reason the arrows sometimes don&#39;t shoot is because of the spectators are in front of you. Keep up the good work!,2017-07-07T14:48:23Z
DanTDM,Play more bedwars please üòÇ,2018-03-16T15:13:32Z

Ninja,"Considering he won a game and came second twice (so almost winning twice) and got a couple of top 8&#39;s and whatnot, I&#39;d say he did amazing. Don&#39;t forget he was wearing a suit more than half the time and had a lot more pressure since there was more people watching and was the center of the attention of actual people on a stage; also the pressure for him too win since it&#39;s his own event. He also died one game from being killed by the winner and one death was him dying after killing someone so he didn&#39;t expect it. He actually did amazing. Especially comparing to how Myth did? Yikes. I still think Ninja is the best honestly.",2018-04-26T08:46:25Z

Must be the music and the overall tone. <br><br>I read somewhere that Robert Kirkman tried to disassociate himself from the game because of lousy reviews. I still enjoy it.

theRadBrad,"Awesome, keep them up I&#39;m enjoying them. One thing I&#39;ll also say is that you need to put auto aim on, relying on deadeye alone is not as fun, deadeye can be used when you&#39;re taking out multiple targets in style. Idk if anyone has mentioned it yet but press R1 on multiple enemies during deadeye and the full advantage of it will be taken",2018-10-31T12:32:21Z

theRadBrad,"MORE!!! POST MORE!!! DROP ALL THE LIKES! I&#39;ve been watching you for years man, i never really commented much or anything. I just put it on full screen and enjoy it. I watch you and Sips, and a few more i watch on and off. But generally both of yous are the guys to watch for gaming. One observation i want to ask you about, ok so you use inverted controls. Up is down, down is up. What was your first game that you ever played? Was it by any chance a fighter jet game of any kind? Like flying? Because you use the basic logic behind controlling an aircraft&#39;s joy stick. You pull the stick towards you to bring the aircraft up. My thoughts are that maybe one of your first ever games was a flying one. But if that is not true and you have not played many games based on flying at all... Maybe you should try one out, as for my observation i would guess that you would be naturally good at them.",2018-10-31T17:56:46Z
theRadBrad,I would like to see more videos from you if that&#39;s possible. I dont personally dont think its spamming at all. I pretty much been watching your videos for a couple years now. I always enjoyed them especially if it&#39;s a game I really like.,2018-10-31T12:16:17Z

IMHO, he has to play through so many games to make money instead of playing fewer games but higher quality play through.<br><br>I like Brad and I think most people offering suggestions do too.  If Brad just listening to what was going on in the game (camp, NPCs say to Arthur, etc.) I bet his view counts would rise because the quality of the play through would be so much higher.",2018-10-31T19:04:00Z

theRadBrad,The game is awesome. Its a simple concept of just doing deliveries but at the same time there&#39;s alot to the game. Thats very intriguing. Not to mention the graphics are amazing.

theRadBrad,You have done a wonderful Job at playing the game and commenting. Your play style is so darn funny and it makes me laugh. You are few years older than my grandsons age and I used to watch them play as I taught them when they were real young. Hearing that you joyfully visit your grandmother and your mother makes me so happy to hear about. You are so right we are here for such a short time and we all should appreciate our time together. Please keep up your video postings of your game play. I do so enjoy them. I lost interest in gaming after my wife passed from breast cancer. We had a short 43 years together. I stumbled on to your videos of this game and it brought me to a place of interest in gaming again since her death. I feel interested in playing again. I usually do not comment ; but I am following your videos. Again Thank you for the fine job! Finnish the game!,2019-11-24T15:55:20Z

theRadBrad,"Just for anyone watching this who is starting to play the game:<br>- Farm a Hornet corrosive legendary pistol from Knuckledragger early on (go to see Hammerlock, then after you&#39;ve leveled up, go BACK to KD to get the Hornet - it can take you up to level 12-15 even if it is level 1)<br>- Farm for a Unkempt Harold legendary explosive pistol from Savage Lee after you get to Sanctuary (seriously, it can take you up to level 15-20)<br>- Farm for a hellfire legendary fire SMG from scorch (again, its incredible splash damage and fire damage belies its specs)<br>- Make sure to pick up the blue rarity Lascaux SMG from the shallow pool in the caves, same place as Scorch (look it up)<br>- Farm for the Nukem rocket launcher from the boss in the area behind Ellie&#39;s garage in The Dust <br>- If you have the money, you can try for one of the Moxxi good touch or bad touch guns, they give you constant health regen and the corrosive one is great against robots.<br><br>This will make the game MUCH easier regardless of which player you pick. I wish someone told me this when I was starting. Just a suggestion!!",2019-01-31T03:17:31Z

GameGrumps,arin doing literally anything but the assigned chores is peak adhd behaviour,2022-11-16T19:15:26Z
GameGrumps,You can‚Äôt run from Sonic forever Arin. He always catches up to you. He is the fastest thing alive.,2022-11-16T18:12:04Z
GameGrumps,This game is a very accurate portrayal of trying to do everyday tasks while suffering from major depressive disorder.,2022-11-18T04:52:56Z
GameGrumps,Arin somehow missing the point that the dude is struggling just to get through the day from depression with all the little hints.,2022-11-16T21:40:06Z
GameGrumps,Anyone else keep yelling at Arin to feed Nugget or was that just me?,2022-11-16T20:05:26Z
GameGrumps,The way this main character encountered one obstacle to starting his day and immediately contemplated giving up is extremely relatable.,2022-11-16T19:28:36Z
GameGrumps,&quot;How did you do this when you were a kid? I just jumped and shooted.&quot;<br><br>Arin perfectly encapsulating the duality of the Grumps.,2022-11-16T18:12:36Z
GameGrumps,"&quot;Does your girlfriend, like, get you?&quot; is the rawest shit Arin has said in a while.",2022-11-16T20:42:53Z
GameGrumps,Maybe they should just let Dan always play the point and click games.,2022-11-16T20:01:38Z
GameGrumps,"I like how Arin was in the kitchen, looked at all the items, clearly hovered over the cat food, and yet failed to find it and feed the cat.",2022-11-16T19:21:28Z
GameGrumps,"game objective; find pants, feed cat, get ready for work<br>Arin the game boy; cleans kitchen and makes the bed, very nice.",2022-11-16T18:27:54Z
GameGrumps,"How does Arin, Owner of cats, not know cats lick their own butts...",2022-11-16T19:12:43Z
GameGrumps,Dude Arin and Dan really sound like the parents who look at a depressed teenager and go ‚ÄúWHAT DO YOU HAVE TO BE DEPRESSED ABOUT?‚Äù,2022-11-22T16:41:21Z
GameGrumps,its funny that the grumps don&#39;t think this guy&#39;s day is that bad when i know for a fact i would go fetal half way through.,2022-11-16T23:52:03Z
GameGrumps,"I&#39;m so upset that after all the effort of finding dirty dishes, Arin never picked up the ones in the basement and finished the task.",2022-11-16T23:45:24Z
GameGrumps,"I&#39;m not sure as it&#39;s only a hour-ish long game and I don&#39;t know the creator&#39;s intent, but this really seems like a story about a person suffering from executive dysfunction. It&#39;s a symptom that often accompanies depression and can make doing &quot;mundane&quot; or &quot;normal&quot; tasks very difficult mentally and emotionally. I appreciate that Carla was supportive and kind at the end there in spite of the difficult time she apparently had.",2022-11-17T03:01:55Z
GameGrumps,"When they gave the character crap for when he went fetal - that part of the game actually hit for me. That&#39;s someone who had an awful day the day before - got in a fight with Carla, the cereal incident - and now everything&#39;s going wrong this morning. When you lose that last spoon, and you don&#39;t have the emotional capacity to deal with anything else, it&#39;s not going from 0 to 100 - it&#39;s going from 95 to 105, and was just getting covered up before.<br><br>Do what you gotta do, Dave. Take your time, take care of yourself. When you&#39;re ready to get up again, you&#39;ve got this. Until then, I understand and have your back.",2022-11-19T01:35:24Z
GameGrumps,"I see this more as a depiction of depression. Some days, its hard to get out of bed.... and then these &quot;little things&quot; Dan and Arin keep joking about, really take a toll on you. To be honest, after he dropped his coffee, I would&#39;ve given up on the day if I was having a depressive episode. The ending was kinda showing how it feels to accomplish even the smallest task.",2022-11-16T23:31:22Z
GameGrumps,"Man, even if things are going okay, you can still feel depressed. I feel you, Dave.",2022-11-16T19:05:09Z
GameGrumps,"This game definitely is reminiscent of Executive Dysfunction, ADHD, Depression, and a few other things you could throw in to make basic chores harder. It was really sweet that Carla was understanding and nice even if it was just minor inconveniences, since trying to force yourself to do chores when suffering a chronic illness, can feel like trying to put your hand on a hot stove at times.",2022-11-16T21:31:50Z
GameGrumps,"I like how at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkV3C5wY6oo&amp;t=51m18s"">51:18</a> Dan&#39;s like &quot;It just gets really heavy&quot; like they didn&#39;t just watch someone almost have a complete emotional breakdown not five minutes prior.",2022-11-23T21:00:28Z
GameGrumps,This game is like... Exactly how executive dysfunction feels,2022-11-16T20:28:56Z
GameGrumps,&quot;gosh i wish i could eat cereal&quot; - Arin<br>the latest 10 minute power hour-,2022-11-16T19:21:08Z
GameGrumps,Dan saying &quot;this humor is like &#39;boss at meeting&#39; humor&quot; infront of his actual boss takes serious balls.,2022-11-16T22:24:45Z
GameGrumps,"This perfectly encapsulates having anxiety when I wake up for work. I&#39;m the guy making excuses to not go, and Arin and Dan are my subconscious yelling at me to JUST GO!!!",2022-11-17T15:20:11Z
GameGrumps,only Arin could play a chore simulator WITH A WALKTHROUGH  and STILL get confused lmfaooo,2022-11-16T19:52:43Z
GameGrumps,"i don&#39;t know how Dan doesn&#39;t give in and say &quot;Arin, please feed the cat&quot;",2022-11-17T00:41:02Z
GameGrumps,i like how Arin picked the perfect voice for the mother before even reading her messages,2022-11-16T18:36:10Z
GameGrumps,I love that a game about finding pants to put on is more Dan‚Äôs speed. üòÇ,2022-11-16T18:19:41Z
GameGrumps,Arin: &quot;cereal is so bad for you!&quot; Also Arin: &quot;ALL ANIMAL FOOD IS DELICIOUS AND GOOD FOR YOU!&quot;,2022-11-16T20:19:32Z
GameGrumps,Arin: ‚ÄúI cant eat cereal it‚Äôs so bad for you‚Äù <br>Danny: has Vietnam flashbacks to literally everything Arins ingested on 10 min power hour,2022-11-18T19:17:53Z
GameGrumps,Subtlety is not Arin‚Äôs strong suit.,2022-11-17T00:44:06Z
GameGrumps,Honestly the cats walk cycle is so delightful that I literally replayed bits where the cat walks a little because it‚Äôs just so enjoyable to see it‚Äôs cute little trot,2022-12-02T02:24:42Z
GameGrumps,"As someone with chronic fatigue and other health issues, this game perfectly emulates what basic tasks feel like to me",2022-11-16T18:51:23Z
GameGrumps,"Arin, fixing a broken hot water heater, a power outage, fumbling with an insane washer, and putting out a fire: These are just normal everyday things!",2022-11-17T01:01:16Z
GameGrumps,Can‚Äôt get over how refined Dan‚Äôs female voice acting is. It‚Äôs so on point.,2022-11-16T18:28:45Z
GameGrumps,as someone who talks to himself like I&#39;m my own best friend I feel attacked,2022-11-16T20:48:54Z
GameGrumps,"This game feels like how my brain is with every task I have to do, to the point I forget what I had started to do in the first place.",2022-11-16T20:22:35Z
GameGrumps,Arin neglecting to feed the cat as it started to meow more and more needily made me almost cry,2022-11-17T01:38:23Z
GameGrumps,Arin: &quot;Cereal is so bad for you&quot;<br>also Arin: orally vacuums 18 variations of Cheerios on 10MPH,2022-11-17T01:59:23Z
GameGrumps,"the ending of this game reminds me of the procrastination episode of spongebob, where spongebob spends all night struggling to find the motivation to write his essay, finally does it and then finds out he didnt actually have to write anything. also both of these things depict what its like to have executive dysfunction pretty well",2022-11-21T14:10:53Z
GameGrumps,If this episode isn&#39;t the perfect expression of ADHD,2022-11-16T18:46:10Z
GameGrumps,I like how Arin was subconsciously thinking of his own cats when he was first reading the to-do list. He said &quot;cats&quot; when there was only one cat and it read as such,2022-11-17T00:36:15Z
GameGrumps,Finally. A point and click game whose theme and tone feel appropriate for the gameplay.,2022-11-16T19:26:39Z
GameGrumps,"I REALLY need Danny to play Darkside Detective. Made by a Sierra fan, I had so much fun with the humor it had and I know Dan would too",2022-11-17T03:17:48Z
GameGrumps,"&quot;I&#39;m just... Reading a book and it&#39;s really compelling!&quot;  Great cover Arin, no one suspects a thing",2022-11-16T19:26:20Z

GameGrumps,"Ooh, an hour long episode. Great, I had a thing to put off",2022-11-16T18:04:28Z
GameGrumps,I actually need to do the dishes and laundry but instead I am watching someone else play a game that has them doing chores.,2022-11-16T19:23:25Z
GameGrumps,"Haha thanks a lot guys. That was hilarious. Don‚Äôt hesitate to play again, The Messenger has a LOT of surprises in store for you to make fun with. üíï",2018-10-08T21:47:54Z
GameGrumps,"&quot;Wow, they&#39;re playing The Messenger! I&#39;m so excited!&quot;<br>*Arin leaves without talking to the Shopkeeper&quot;<br>&quot;THIS PLAYTHROUGH IS DEAD!&quot;",2018-10-09T06:23:40Z
GameGrumps,I hope they quote Arin for game reviews <br><br>&quot;This game rips shit&quot; -Arin Hanson,2018-10-08T20:29:21Z
GameGrumps,-Hey Billy what was your favorite Game Grumps episode?<br>-I really like the one where Arin talked about his shits for a looooong time,2018-10-08T18:31:07Z

GameGrumps,"Man, I wish they played it long enough to show off the most unique feature of the game. You swap between 8-bit and 16-bit versions of the game.",2018-10-08T18:37:46Z
GameGrumps,"This game really deserves and needs the exposure.  Last I heard, even though The Messenger received many positive reviews, its sales were particularly low for an indie game on Switch, which is a real shame.  This game is super fun, creative, challenging and witty, and anyone with a love of call-back platformers like this should play it.  And if you are interested, I&#39;d recommend simply buying it and not watching any trailers or gameplay videos beyond the early game, as they may spoil the game&#39;s most important mechanic.  Hell, the game even makes a joke itself about that mechanic being spoiled in the trailer.",2018-10-08T23:26:51Z
GameGrumps,If you will make this a series and not just a single episode PLEASE talk chat more with the shop keeper cuz half of this game&#39;s humor is mainly in the conversations with him,2018-10-08T19:32:00Z
GameGrumps,"Huh.   A ninja game.  If only they knew a practicing parishioner of ninjitsu to have given their highly qualified, some might even say, doctoral, review of this game.",2018-10-08T23:20:46Z
GameGrumps,"Why is it that literally no one I know could relate to my bathroom habits but then Arin comes in and just absolutely justified my habits as natural, what is this weird sense of relation with him I feel right now?",2018-10-09T05:48:42Z
GameGrumps,Do you guys ever think you&#39;ll ever finish the game? It&#39;s incredible,2020-09-02T15:50:20Z
GameGrumps,I have never related more to Arin than the poop talk in this video,2018-10-08T19:19:42Z
GameGrumps,I need to buy this game eventually,2018-10-08T18:14:40Z

GameGrumps,Aww I&#39;d love to see more episodes of this!,2018-10-09T16:51:17Z
GameGrumps,I would have loved it if all 4 of that giant-ass demon‚Äôs heads all had their own individual personalities and dialogue.  And the four of them are constantly arguing or something.,2018-10-08T18:26:57Z
GameGrumps,please keep this one going!! indie sidescrollers always have the best stories,2018-10-11T18:02:57Z

GameGrumps,Arin&#39;s fake story about the creator of Biker Mice reminded me of what happened to the director of one of the shittiest movies I&#39;ve ever seen. A man named Tom Graeff created &quot;Teenagers from Outer Space&quot;. The movie bombed and he had a breakdown and claimed he was the second coming of Christ. Then he killed himself by locking himself in his garage with his car running.,2014-01-16T23:44:54Z

GameGrumps,"This is a fantastic single player AND multiplayer game. Fairly easy to pick up (if you know the controls anyway), but difficult to master.  The controls are great, very responsive, and the combination of unique powerups and ammo ensures there&#39;s no shortage of action when you meet your rivals on the track. Really fun.",2018-09-25T11:43:23Z

GameGrumps,Ahhh the smell of Woolie&#39;s saltyness is still fresh in the air. ¬†,2014-01-16T22:08:48Z
GameGrumps,"I think i speak for all my other fellow grumps here when i say it&#39;s great and nostalgic when Arin and Dan play a classic SNES game. And im not talking about the really popular ones, but rather the ones that get overlook like &quot;Cool Spot&quot; and &quot;Biker Mice From Mars&quot; the lsit is endless. I hope dan and Arin take more time digging deep into the SNES vault and continue to give us amazing episodes where we can all take a trip to our beloved childhood.",2014-01-18T05:11:24Z
GameGrumps,"Biker mice from mars were brilliant, I&#39;ve still got a video of them somewhere. You don&#39;t hear them mentioned often these days but they were by far the coolest heroes of the old cartoons",2014-01-16T23:16:36Z

GameGrumps,This game was my childhood. You don&#39;t understand how joyful and painful this was to watch. P.S.- Karbunkle&#39;s shot is what was turning Danny into the &quot;potato&quot; man. You can bump racers with that crazy spin Vinny has. The obvious Mario Kart style specials at the top of the screen are used by pressing B if um remembering correctly. And Moto is the best!!,2016-12-13T11:26:45Z
GameGrumps,Dan hopped up on sugar is the beginning of a spiral of cause-effect hyping up between these two and it&#39;s hilarious.,2016-12-02T19:32:15Z
GameGrumps,I never would have thought that they would ever play this game. Biker Mice is one of my favorite racing games of all time.,2014-01-16T22:12:20Z
GameGrumps,"Grew up with this game was my 5th birthday present. Very very hard game to master, but its a lot of fun. Vinny and the grey mouse (used to say gotcha) where my faves.

It spawned one of my favorite GG memes of all time, the Akira joke.  &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3<br><br>Also does anyone else miss this style of editing?  I deeply miss having the mysterious silent editor only existing through the on screen edits (although obviously I&#39;m happy to have Barry on the show now too).",2016-12-02T09:24:02Z
GameGrumps,"I totally fucking remember these things. I used to have so many of those toys when I was younger. Vinnie was my favourite of them... Not because I liked him, but rather because his antennae(which could slide in and out of his head) were bent, thus never allowing the sliding gimmick to work properly. This always amused me as a child, for some reason.",2015-06-11T22:50:45Z

GameGrumps,"Guys, you need to gather resources yourself by picking them up and dropping them onto your storage building. The turtle can build and do stuff automatically. Make to villagers build buildings, reproduce and gather resources, while you gather resources etc. Then you can add villages and expand your territory. Else you gonna be smitten by satan...<br><br>But it is a pretty weird game so I get the confusion. Also please don&#39;t let satan kill this playthrough, I love it.",2014-11-05T22:27:35Z

GameGrumps,Black and White is actually really fun. I wonder if they realize they&#39;re not playing the beginning of 2‚Ä¶ It looks like an expansion. Cause the original starts off fighting the Aztecs and freeing the Greeks.,2014-11-06T06:32:40Z
GameGrumps,"Loved both Black&amp;White games, havent played in ages but watching them play this is dreadful. But entertaining. In a masochistic way.",2014-11-05T22:10:52Z

GameGrumps,I thought this game was hella easy to play. How can Ross make it seem so difficult? He&#39;s not picking up on context clues maybe cause he&#39;s hungover ...,2014-11-05T22:58:32Z
GameGrumps,I thought the point of playthroughs are to see how the lets player interacts and thinks of the game an it doesnt have to mean they are good at it or have to be good at it ,2014-11-05T21:18:45Z

GameGrumps,"The motion controls in Skyward Sword worked perfectly fine for me. It made it a little more entertaining than just mashing B a bunch of times to attack. My only gripe is the bullshit where you have to collect the little light orbs, those levels were frustrating.",2014-08-10T21:20:17Z

Otherwise, I had no problems with the mechanics used with the wii motion plus. I barely had to re-calibrate the wiimote, and the combat was seamless. I don&#39;t mind if Arin states that he himself was having issues, but I hate how he phrases it as fact.¬†",2014-08-10T21:31:40Z

GameGrumps,There are a lot of games that have you hurt badguys by bumping into them. The first one that comes to mind for me is Ys Book I&amp;II for the TurboGrafx/TurboDuo. I would LOVE to see them play some TurboDuo games. They need an addition to GG that plays the &quot;retro&quot; games (proper &quot;retro&quot; not what many gamers consider to be retro these days). They clearly do it now and then but it would be so good to have one who focuses on those games.,2014-08-10T21:39:28Z

GameGrumps,"I know Arin was saying it sarcastically, but that game where you hurt enemies by touching them is actually a good idea. Like enemies would have melee or distance weapons and they would always avoid you, which could lead you around platforming obstacles. or every level could be like the nabbit levels from mario bros U where you have one enemy to kill but you have to traverse some kind of obstacle course to catch them and you&#39;re rewarded for doing it quicker.",2015-07-24T02:09:49Z

CoryxKenshin,"I feel like this whole game was a message about the youth and their toxic love affair with drugs.. Dude shows up at a party, takes some drugs then has no idea what&#39;s going on, where he is, who he&#39;s talking to and who he&#39;s about to sleep with. Vinny sounds like this voice coming from somewhere out of reality because dude is super effed up on drugs. The player experiences his hallucinations and confusion, then at the end when dude is coming off the drugs everything becomes a LITTLE more clear.¬†",2014-07-28T17:36:03Z
CoryxKenshin,Cory&#39;s face after the credits were finished was my exact reaction,2016-02-15T03:08:23Z
CoryxKenshin,This is the most awkward &amp; screwed up plot twist I have ever seen &amp; encountered.,2014-06-21T09:47:00Z
CoryxKenshin,The writing for this game was perfection.,2015-09-12T05:24:37Z
CoryxKenshin,I really liked the twisted ending because it adds more twist to the story. This game is a 10-10! Can&#39;t get better.,2015-08-24T07:24:34Z
CoryxKenshin,This is one of the best games i have ever played :0 its awesome,2014-07-30T18:18:57Z
CoryxKenshin,&quot;Was that good acting?&quot; That killed me. x&#39;D,2015-05-24T15:16:26Z
CoryxKenshin,"This game remind me so much of Stanley¬¥s Parallel. Love the dialogue, the voice acting and the puzzles were so much fun even to just watch. Very creative and original.",2014-08-19T21:02:18Z
CoryxKenshin,I love this guys videos because he doesn&#39;t talk during the fucking dialogue! :)<br>¬†,2014-09-05T03:06:45Z
CoryxKenshin,"so I just finished the game and wanted to see if there was any videos on it, stumbled across this and wanted to clarify: <b>SPOILER ALERT BELOW DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE ENDING RUINED</b><br><br><br>Basically Vinny is Sam&#39;s godfather, there was a third speaker that was projecting the voice of her real dad, Stephano, who is the guy Vinny talks to in the windmill, now I cant really explain the game itself too much but from what I gather it was all kind of a... a parallel to what was actually going on, the breaking of pots, is (from what I thought) you getting high at the party, like I said I cant really explain the whole windmill and the clocks and door thing too much or even the park but what I said is what I understood, apparently Vinny was drugging the guys at the party who were trying to hook up with Sam and Anthony was one of those guys (seeing as how he didnt know) the game itself is supposed to be that drug trip, however it shows you what happened that night in parallel as I said earlier... maybe I&#39;m wrong but idk this is what I thought of the plot.",2014-07-28T05:48:22Z

CoryxKenshin,The graphics of this game is amazing :D this hard part of the game reminds me of the time I was playing prototype 2 and the boss battle at the end was really difficult and annoying haha XD,2014-06-29T05:40:59Z
CoryxKenshin,"LOL!! Even if I didn&#39;t love this game, this is the most awesome walkthru evar!<br><br>One thing to note... in the level &#39;Blind&#39; (with the slot machine), if you don&#39;t break it or push it, you end up getting stuck in a maze &#39;sacrificing&#39; pawns until you &#39;die&#39; and the level starts all over again. And you can get to the level &#39;windmill&#39; (which is where you go if you sacrifice Sam) but I can&#39;t figure out how to get out of it.<br><br>Amazing review and walkthru.",2015-03-11T17:19:47Z

CoryxKenshin,"Oooh, Anthony, you defini--- I can&#39;t believe I felt an impulse to call you Anthony, haha-- you definitely must play <b>The Stanley Parable</b>, to me, <b>that</b> would be the first game I&#39;d truly call part of an 8th artform. It cleverly makes you notice what&#39;s interactivity&#39;s place in storytelling, and in a much funnier experience than this one.<br>Speaking of it: <b>WHAT?</b> Look... I just won&#39;t praise this because there&#39;s a difference between leaving <i>loose ends</i> in your story and just leaving freakin&#39; <i>holes</i> !

CoryxKenshin,Okay so here&#39;s my take: At some point during the party he was drugged and so while drugged he goes through this trip that helps him sort through these memories that helps him realize/remember that the girl he wants to sleep with is in fact his sister? o_o....O_O.... <b>brainsplosion</b> Damn that&#39;s nuts. Straight up insane. Awesome play through Cory XD. Hey you know what&#39;d be fun? Corpse Party! :D,2014-06-21T03:34:56Z

I fell in love with his recording style, his comedy, his editing, and the fact that he never curses. I just am so happy that one day i looked up &#39;Chum bucket wants my krabby patty&#39; xD",2016-12-26T00:57:03Z

CoryxKenshin,"Cory, this is what you need to do. Up the brightness in the options first. The reason your lights went out? Check the generator ever so often... the extra rooms are important. Also very important as well, when you turn your flashlight on and check the hallways, it is easier to see the aminitronics looking at your door. Plus that robot that kept killing you? That was Karen ;).",2015-05-13T01:09:58Z

CoryxKenshin,"This game is so scary. All except for the creepy guy on the phone. He tried a southern accent immitation, but wasn&#39;t very good at it, and then kinda navigated away from it. That was pretty funny. The twist on the doors are pretty cool, though. There&#39;s unlimited power, but limited use of the power. And, stuff can overheat. Scary.",2015-12-31T05:00:59Z

CoryxKenshin,"You&#39;re suppose to keep an eye on the generators, one of the animatronics goes down there to mess with them and it cuts off the power then kills you. You keep an eye on the generators and press the red button to chase it away from them. And yes, would love to see a part 2! :D",2015-05-13T03:06:16Z

CoryxKenshin,"I believe that&#39;s Sandy killing you; she makes inventions and things, so that would make sense that she&#39;s fiddling with the generator&#39;s mechanics. When the lights are flickering like that, I believe you have to use overdrive, even though you&#39;ll only be allowed to use one piece of equipment once it&#39;s run out for a while. I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re playing it though! It&#39;s so good~<br>if you want to know who comes through the vents, I&#39;ll let you know after the break here<br>-

In the plane, George actually had worse seat then another ones. George is the one, who actually tries to figure out where they are flying, using the compass (everyone was just looking through the window ü§∑üèª) and his knowledge of geography (you gonna be a good teacher, George üòâ). No one actually put him up to the team, and he tried to made us sure about he&#39;s alright. When there were red lines, George&#39;s one was the hardest (actually was almost the level of his maximum; and the other ones had some space to move the finger down). Actually, I keep forgetting how to breath all the video, cause i was pretty sure, George gonna make it in his honest way. It was so heartbreaking prank in the end, but it was as heartbreaking as seeing George&#39;s reaction of 16 hours doing this so hard and as the result have nothing :(<br><br>One of the great moments was the way how Nolan tried to wear a hoodie with George ( it&#39;s almost melt my heart ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíî).

GeorgeNotFound,"I still remember watching this when it kept coming up in my recommended. It was the first time I had rewatched Minecraft after several years. I also remember thinking that Dream was being rude, and I also watched the video where he was a parrot afterward. At that point, my mind was already made up that Dream was being a jerk to George, but as I watched more, I realized that I actually liked watching these kinds of videos. So, over a year later, I still watch them and a huge fan of the SMP and all the amazing people in the community (of course, not the toxic side). I&#39;m so happy that I actually stayed though, 2021 has been one of the happiest years of my life. All of these laughs and new content never fail to make me smile. Getting my first merch from Bad&#39;s shop, watching streams back-to-back while late at night, and showing some of the members to my sisters and them enjoying them, and noticing people at my new school wearing some merch has made me so happy. I honestly can&#39;t thank you enough with this video, George :) I can&#39;t believe that it&#39;s been so long in such a short amount of time :,)",2022-01-30T21:16:20Z

iHasCupquake,"Do you remember the room where you found B-12 ? The chamber (sarcophagus) must have the remains of the scientist inside. The broken (beheaded) robot supposed to be the vessel for him, but something went wrong. Actually all the robots could be the previous humans. How do you explain Doc and his son or the knitting robot grandma? The robots data-storage were to small, so the couldn&#39;t upload all memories.",2022-08-27T19:18:15Z

iHasCupquake,You are on the right track because in a previous episode you did learn that the Zurks were initially for garbage disposal and then they went rogue. But I bet you didn&#39;t know that something similar is being developed currently IRL. Apparently some form of bacteria is now being trained to dispose of plastic. I&#39;m wondering if the Zurks themselves are robots or bacteria as well,2022-08-27T19:02:22Z

iHasCupquake,I&#39;m so glad I can speak on this now so the theory that&#39;s going around because of B-12 is the fact that the companion bots are probably humans uploaded into the machines. I was waiting for you to discover this first before I said anything,2022-08-27T18:43:25Z

iHasCupquake,"A suggestion might be to use the fabric for the entire black part of the eye instead of only a small part. The real eye holes were very noticeable, and it was hard to see this as a shy guy unless i squinted to make the darker eye dots &quot;disappear&quot;. If the reason for this is because the eyes wont be rounded, i don&#39;t think that&#39;s much of a problem. If it is, then use very small holed plastic canvas and color that black with some spray paint or something. (Acrylic paint clogs up the holes more easily.) Just an idea for anyone who plans on doing this DIY! Amazing as always Cupquake~",2016-10-07T19:34:50Z

I mean, she seems to get over it rather quickly when the guy shows up, or when you refuse to kiss her.

TBH, as much as there is that natural spark/attraction with Yen, she seems a bit sly/underhand/self centred/overly-political.

MegMage,"This whole quest and the mages trapped in Novigrad is probably the biggest plot hole of the W3. Why wouldn&#39;t the mages just teleport out of the city? IDK if it&#39;s mentioned anywhere but it feels like because they needed someone to for Triss to rescue but only had the most powerful people in the north,  so they stripped them of their power.",2022-06-12T17:56:10Z

MegMage,"This cutscene is very important and helps us understand Cole better. Remember, Cole was always presented as this war hero, and now we know the truth: he was no hero. He only got that medal because he happened to be the only survivor of that battle. Phelps is traumatized, and he feels he didn‚Äòt deserve the medal. He has survivor‚Äòs guilt. That‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt talk about the war and why he tries to atone through his work as a detective. But there‚Äòs a lot more about his past you‚Äòve yet to find out.<br><br>I won‚Äòt spoil it, but the next mission is the climax, and things will happen and be revealed that will surprise you and make you see Phelps in a whole new light. Many people who are on their first playthrough are often quite shocked and confused, but keep at it and it will all make sense once the full story unfolds during the following cases.",2022-03-19T18:14:05Z
MegMage,"I really enjoy this part of the story because it shows how Cole went to war with the mentality of making a name for himself, but after his friends and squad got killed and he got his silver medal, he hates it because he feels that he didn&#39;t deserve it. Kelso&#39;s line about their job being to die for your future really hits Phelps right there.",2022-03-19T21:18:01Z
MegMage,Cole asking Roy to drive to the police station that they were next to is like when a customer demands to speak to the manager and they already are.,2022-03-24T07:31:03Z
MegMage,"This is the best case. Feels like the pinnacle of LA Noire with it being the most ‚ÄòHollywood‚Äô case in the game, full of twists and all these other fun elements. There‚Äôs a bit of interrogating, chasing, tailing, etc.<br><br>Cole is at the top of his detective game here too, Roy is least sufferable in this case compared to others, you work with your old partners, etc.",2022-06-20T03:12:15Z

MegMage,"The discussion where Phelps and Earl talk about the former partners is funny.  I personally disliked Galloway (Rusty/Finbar) at first, because of all the crude remarks he would make, especially about his ex-wives and general anti-woman attitude.  I still don&#39;t exactly like Galloway but, with time, you got to see there was a bit of softer side underneath the jaded cynic that peeked out from time to time.  It made me at least have some sympathy towards Galloway.  Whereas, in comparison, Earl never seems to have anything but cynical self-centred motivations to him.  It makes him very unsympathetic.",2022-04-15T16:56:41Z

MegMage,"IMO the cutscene where Eagle Flies comes to Arthur and Dutch for help with the horses was one of the times where I REALLY hated Dutch. It a self serving act disguised as an act of altruism.<br>He sees an angry young man who is on the edge and all he needs is a little push to create chaos for Dutch. Dutch senses this and preys on it. He&#39;s such a scumbag that he even tells EF to put his money away as if he&#39;s doing this out of the kindness of his heart.<br><br> I&#39;m left to wonder if Arthur in this moment looked back at his childhood when he first met Dutch and saw himself in Eagle Flies, and it infuriated him as he was used just like Dutch uses this poor kid. <br><br>This was one of the cutscenes that really made me angry at Dutch. Sacrificing an entire tribe who has already been through enough hardship just to give him a chance to escape?? Total prick.",2021-05-20T23:46:18Z

MegMage,"Hi Princess I mean Meghan :-))<br>now it is not long now and you have reached the end of the journey. It makes me a bit sad but I still enjoy every episode to the end. I wish you a lot of fun playing on, have a nice weekend and lovely greetings to you and your sweet Yuna. <br>Too bad you didn&#39;t examine Benson&#39;s bedroom, then you would have seen what perverted things he still does",2022-04-14T21:05:00Z
MegMage,I love this game. Finished it a long time ago. But you‚Äôve also missed searching the rest of Benson‚Äôs apartment at the beginning of your video. You won‚Äôt like what nasty man was doing.,2022-04-14T15:28:36Z
MegMage,"Yay! Monroe finally got what he deserved! He‚Äòs the number 1 Big Bad, and the mastermind behind the whole Suburban Redevelopment Fund conspiracy (that actually goes even further than you now think - you‚Äòll soon find out). Unfortunately, you still have to deal with Big Bad number 2 (Dr Fontaine, who is voiced by Peter Blomquist aka Micah Bell !) and the guy who starts the fires.<br><br>You did miss a very disturbing scene, tho. In Curtis Benson‚Äòs house, you could have gone into the bedroom. There, you would have found a naked 12 year old girl in his bed. Makes you want to punch him a few more times.<br><br>And yes, Roy Earle signed that report. Roy is also involved in the Suburban Redevelopment Fund (no surprise there!). But Roy is probably also trying to blackmail Fontaine and possibly Monroe.<br><br>The next case is the final DLC case, which you play as Cole and which takes place at the same time as this one (that‚Äôs why Cole didn‚Äòt join in the attack). After that, we‚Äòll get to the grand finale.",2022-04-14T16:33:53Z

MegMage,Another great video again by my number one favourite youtuber ever,2022-04-12T17:28:48Z
MegMage,No jack Kelso is a different person to jack Marston. Jack Marston was nearing his teens at the beginning of the 20th century (1900s) and LA Noire is placed after just after WW2.,2022-04-14T17:09:53Z
MegMage,Luckily you didn&#39;t search his bedroom,2022-08-11T12:41:56Z
MegMage,"No connection between Kelso and Jack Marston. Jack Marston was born in 1895, so by 1947 he‚Äôd be 52 and thus would have been too old to have served in WW2 like Kelso did.",2022-04-15T01:13:47Z

MegMage,Cillian&#39;s portrayal of scarecrow is one my favorite on screen villain adaptations for the DCU so far!! They need to use scarecrow more in the live action movies,2023-01-05T18:13:02Z
MegMage,"Oh and yeah Begins and Dark Knight were adored for some great comic book/Animated series refs at the time. We hadn&#39;t seen them depicted on the Silver Screen in a while. Especially not this way... Love that having <b>some</b> context made ya teary, Meg; Lovely to see this Universe start to mean as much to someone &#39;&#39;new&#39;&#39; as it does to us &lt;3",2023-01-05T07:56:33Z
MegMage,"Michael Caine&#39;s Alfred, Morgan Freeman&#39;s Lucius Fox, Gary Oldman&#39;s Gordon etc.<br>The support cast of this trilogy was on a different level.",2023-01-05T21:09:42Z
MegMage,This trilogy and The Batman are phenomenal films,2023-01-05T18:09:42Z
MegMage,"To quote the movies‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶ here‚Ä¶ we‚Ä¶ go.‚Äù<br><br>THIS is going to be so much fun. My smile is so ludicrously big. I will be a Superman fan until my dying day, but this take on Batman is so awesome, I cannot help but be a fan of it. Enjoy!",2023-01-05T17:51:38Z
MegMage,"Rachel is a love interest that Nolan made up for the trilogy, which is why you don‚Äôt recognize her. But I wouldn‚Äôt say she‚Äôs just a ‚Äúrandom girl‚Äù, but you‚Äôll see when you watch them. I assume Nolan chose to avoid any pre-established love interest to keep comic fans on their toes. Also to keep them focused on the movie that‚Äôs in front of their face instead of on comparing it to the comics or theorizing on future events.",2023-01-05T23:31:24Z
MegMage,"I just love watching u react , I‚Äôve watched tons off ppl become Batman fans after reacting to this trilogy , watching u react is such amazing experience",2023-02-01T21:29:37Z

MegMage,Oooooh so excited for a reaction to this trilogy. Love your guys‚Äô film reactions.,2023-01-05T18:21:50Z
MegMage,"Watching the Dark Knight&#39;s trailer back  all these years later, they really did a great job at hiding the awesomeness of Ledger&#39;s performance.",2023-01-05T21:16:14Z
MegMage,"This trilogy set the bar for DC live action.  Hopefully Matt Reeves can keep up, The Batman is now my 3rd favorite Batman film behind The Dark Knight and Tim Burton&#39;s 89 classic.",2023-01-05T20:01:12Z
MegMage,&quot;The Batman&quot; by Matt Reeves was incredible too,2023-01-05T23:35:42Z
MegMage,I was 10 when begins came out. I was a huge Batman fan but I‚Äôd never seen any of them in the cinema. Just the original 4 on VHS and the animated series on tv. I remember first seeing the poster for begins in the cinema window as I walked past. I couldn‚Äôt believe a batman movie was going to be in the cinema. The Nolan trilogy has a very special place in my heart. I also adored Matt reeves the batman last year,2023-01-05T22:34:29Z
MegMage,Watching you as a non fan then become a Batman fan was a joyful experience.,2023-01-08T17:10:16Z
MegMage,"Not gonna lie, very excited to see you react to this trilogy.üíØ",2023-01-05T18:07:57Z
MegMage,"Rachel is most-likely a variation on Vicki Vale.  They were going for hard ‚Äúrealism‚Äù with these movies.  Essentially, what would these characters look and sound like if they existed in the real, ‚Äúgrounded‚Äù world?  Meanwhile, DC Comics has always had a thing for alliterative names.  ‚ÄúLex Luthor,‚Äù ‚ÄúLois Lane,‚Äù ‚ÄúLana Lang,‚Äù ‚ÄúClark Kent,‚Äù et cetera.  ‚ÄúVicki Vale‚Äù was probably a bit too on-the-nose for Nolan and company, so she became ‚ÄúRachel Dawes,‚Äù a name that sounds more like the name of someone you‚Äôd randomly meet in the real world.  Rachel‚Äôs role as ‚ÄúADA that Batman helps‚Äù in ‚ÄúBatman Begins‚Äù was originally meant to be Harvey Dent, before they decided to save Harvey for later, since it was just a glorified cameo.  So they combined that character with the ‚Äúlove interest‚Äù character, making both roles much-more fleshed-out, as they were now one person, with more cumulative screentime than either character would have had individually.  This follows Rachel being an expy for Vicki, since, in the comics, Vicki is a long-time on-again, off-again girlfriend to Bruce, and a journalist, rather than a lawyer, so, close enough?",2023-01-05T17:21:18Z
MegMage,"Frankly starting with the animated stuff is probably the best way to start. Some of the best stuff is the animated ones, like The Dark Knight Returns.  Hell, one of the best Batman versions comes from a Flash movie",2023-01-07T14:12:45Z
MegMage,Have you not seen the Batman quadrilogy from 1989 to 1997? You need to watch those movies to understand how and why the Nolan Trilogy is so important to Batman&#39;s film history.,2023-01-05T17:08:07Z
MegMage,These are honestly my favourite films of all time. Please watch them. It‚Äôs one of Cillian Murphy‚Äôs first big roles :),2023-01-05T17:13:29Z
MegMage,We all would love if you reacted to the Tim Burton Batman films.,2023-01-05T17:28:15Z
MegMage,Love this trilogy! Right next to planet of the apes for me and Heath licked his lips a lot cause of the make up it kept coming off so they just had that be a thing his character did,2023-01-05T07:39:22Z
MegMage,Please watch the trilogy Meg! üòä,2023-01-05T17:13:06Z
MegMage,"There&#39;s one thing that I never see people talk about with Heath Ledger&#39;s Joker: how the make-up ages him. When he filmed it, he was in his mid-to-late twenties, but he looks almost 60.",2023-01-05T17:57:10Z
MegMage,My favorite film of all time.  Can&#39;t wait.,2023-01-06T14:46:33Z
MegMage,The Nolan trilogy was made to be a more real world take on the Batman mythos. So there isn&#39;t much in terms of supernatural and sci-fi characters like superpowers and stuff.,2023-01-05T21:20:46Z
MegMage,Would love to see you react to the original Tim Burton Batman movie from 1989 starring Michael Keaton,2023-01-06T09:39:48Z
MegMage,It‚Äôs a shock as an Irish person to here someone from the US pronounce Cillian Murphy‚Äôs name right,2023-01-05T18:27:42Z
MegMage,These trailers still give me hype,2023-01-05T16:58:15Z
MegMage,"The Dark Knight- the best Joker hands down in a live action film! RIP Heath Ledger, that role overtook him unfortunately but he left us with a beautiful piece of work ! Great reactions !",2023-01-06T05:48:19Z
MegMage,Ahh man I&#39;m so excited for you to get into the Nolan Live Action Batman movies!,2023-01-05T15:12:44Z
MegMage,now i need a reaction video to this movieüòÑ,2023-01-05T17:23:14Z
MegMage,"I was not expecting you guys to react to the trailers for these but hey anytime you guys react to anything DC or Marvel related I&#39;m all here for. I can&#39;t wait for when you eventually react to the Nolan trilogy. I absolutely love how hyped you were getting while watching these. And you being like, &quot;WHO THE FUCK IS RACHEL?!&quot; I don&#39;t blame you since I personally never cared much for her in these movies either. Also unrelated to the Nolan trilogy, but I also hope you guys rewatch Matt Reeves&#39; The Batman movie with the deleted Joker scene since I think you guys said you haven&#39;t seen it yet. Of course that&#39;s for future stuff so no rush if you guys do plan on doing a rewatch. But thanks for this unexpected reaction!",2023-01-05T07:42:15Z
MegMage,FFS now I wanna watch this trilogy again for the 100th time,2023-01-07T12:54:25Z
MegMage,"Eventually you need to watch the Michael Keaton batman movies from 1989 and 1992 it&#39;s my favorite live action Batman highly recommend. p.s, those movies inspired the animated series.",2023-01-06T01:03:17Z
MegMage,"&quot;It has Scarecrow&#39;s horse?!&quot; Yeah they wanted Scarecrow, but he costed too much, so they only got his horse for the movie haha",2023-01-05T20:26:55Z
MegMage,You should also watch Dark knight returns. It‚Äôs about old Bruce,2023-01-05T17:17:41Z
MegMage,Turns out that Joker &quot;improvised&quot; detonator scene wasn&#39;t actually improvised it was actually scripted.,2023-01-05T19:38:12Z
MegMage,"On ur journey u should react to the other Batman live action films too like Batman 89, Batman Returns, and Batman vs Superman and maybe a rewatch of The Batman",2023-01-06T03:18:19Z
MegMage,"Well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs too late to say this, but TDKR trailer has at least two spoilers about TDK. <br>I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre all that noticeable until you watch TDK though, so it probably won‚Äôt matter.",2023-01-05T17:51:55Z
MegMage,The only batman film that is anything like the animated series is Matt Reeves The Batman. Nolan made batman too realistic and Snyder made batman a killer. The only batman that stay honestly true to both the comics and the animated series is Robert Pattinson,2023-01-06T18:24:30Z
MegMage,Highly recommend watching Gotham (DC Show) the way they did joker is crazy,2023-01-05T18:30:42Z
MegMage,"Begins is eh, but still kinda good (was def great at the time, and still has some iconic moments). Dark Knight is still great, though fairly laggy in parts. Rises......................------ <br><br>The Batman was epic and <b>finally</b> dethroned Nolan as definitive Silver Screen Bats rep., and I was so glad for it. <b>Cannot wait</b> to see what R-Patts does with Bruce/Bats in the 2024 Sequel, since it&#39;ll most likely be set a few years later in Universe as well (hopefully). Animated Series Bats/the entire DCAU remains <b>peak</b> , <b>untouchable</b> DC though ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",2023-01-05T07:44:45Z

alliebeemac,go back to the first spirit well and then climb the wall to the right. while that is the optional area it is where the dash ability is and one more ability is that is needed for a bunch of not quite side areas but optional rewards on the main paths.,2017-09-25T21:22:34Z

Also Sein said &quot;The Water&#39;s FLOW&quot; thourhgt it so you just turned the tap back on but since it had a bunch of gunk in it that needed to be flushed out you got chased by the cleaning/boot up the flow systems is my theory.<br><br>As for the Dash Ability Head back to the first save point you found after the very start of the game and climb the wall to go to the area where the ability can be found. there are technically 2 skills in the area but the second one you need to have yet another skill to reach even deeper into that area.

In the game, she is guarding Yggdrasil&#39;s roots, but in the original Norse mythology, Nidhoggr is a HE and he&#39;s actually trying to KILL Yggdrasil by CHEWING on its roots (in some versions Nidhoggr is actually ENTANGLED in the roots of Yggdrasil and he&#39;s trying to free himself).  Also, fun fact about Nidhoggr, he is the main inspiration behind the Dragon Alduin in the game Elder Scrolls V:  Skyrim, because just like Alduin, Nidhoggr feeds on the souls of the dead.  He does so after Ragnarok has occurred, and he has a particular appetite for the souls of those who have committed murder, rape, and/or adultery.",2022-11-26T09:01:16Z

Both have reasons for being upset (Freya was sold essentially to a toxic, abusive monster then imprisoned in Midgard with only a window to her home that she could never return to and Freyr was nearly burned alive by the Aesir after teaching them his magic, if you look at his arms you&#39;ll see the warped skin from the burns).  Both are hurt, and clearly mourning how they missed each other, but the pain allows them to get riled up fast.  Especially the more you learn about them, and how it was basically them fighting for their people until Odin and Mimir showed up.  Freya thought she was protecting her people, and Freyr was trying to help by teaching them to raise crops.  Neither knew exactly how bad the Aesir were and how they would quickly take and then break their promises.  After all, there was SUPPOSED to be peace, then Freya got to watch them set her brother on fire, and THEN be forced to marry Odin, who pulled a &#39;it was them, not ME&#39; on her to keep her from breaking off the marriage.

alliebeemac,Freya wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúsold‚Äù to Odin. She and Odin both agreed to the marriage proposed by Mimir. She and Odin were at many times enjoying the marriage but then it turned sour. A lot of people in Vanaheim noticed and hated her for it. There is nuance but Freya wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúforced‚Äù. Her people including her brother didn‚Äôt mind continuing the war but she made that decision on her own to stop it.,2022-11-28T11:43:42Z

alliebeemac,RIP Part 7 üòî,2022-06-24T21:53:33Z
alliebeemac,"I haaattteee the pull up game, Every single round is randomized, so it&#39;s impossible to even try to memorize, and the timing is whack. I just gave up on the expert difficulty version. Also, the Sewers quest is not a side-quest, it&#39;s main quest. You must do it to go forward, because you need the grappling hooks to go up, it just also ties into the Angel of the Slums sidequest if you&#39;re doing that one. I&#39;m glad that missing the optional Angel quest didn&#39;t block you off from the conclusion of that particular plot/mystery. <br><br><br>Little trivia bits about the OG- in the original version, Midgar slums have thick walls blocking off each sector, which prevents even the little amount of sunlight you see in this version (they&#39;re basically eternally in nightfall, and this is discussed in the first train scene in the OG, Cloud and Barret talk longer in that one, where it seems abruptly cut off in this one). This impacted the fall of Sector 7 in two significant ways: first, evacuation was completely impossible, because exits were bottle necked at doors, and the plate itself fell in one solid chunk, like a giant crusher slamming down into the ground. IMO, it made the scene where it fell way more terrifying to watch even though it was low-poly. Also, rather than using grappling hooks, they literally climbed up debris and the sheer wall to go up, which is where you learn that Barret is scared of heights. (the section with the sunlamps and all that leading into Reactor 5 is not in the original, so you don&#39;t get the opportunity to learn this before).<br><br><br>Also, my favorite affection scene was Aeris, because I just love the way Cloud reacts to Aeris. Although he&#39;s generally at ease and comfortable with Tifa, he&#39;s softest and most earnest with Aeris, and as cold and traumatized as he is, his connection with Aeris is adorable.",2020-04-27T11:59:54Z

alliebeemac,"Sean is one of the most, if not the most, strongest characters in a video game I&#39;ve ever seen. He constantly was beaten down physically and emotionally, but always got back up and kept going. Even his notebook had the line &quot;we have to keep going&quot;. Every obstacle he faced he conquered. Even in the end, I don&#39;t count it as a surrender, but facing another feat and doing what he has to do for Daniel. <br><br><br>This story was so good from start to finish. I loved that they incorporated and highlighted very real and raw racial and immigration issues Latinos face within our society and the politics involved. It&#39;s amazing to see that game developers are able to not only combine the real world and fantasy, but do so accurately and organically. They didn&#39;t use stereotypes to create and develop their main characters, which is always amazing when the story is about people of color. <br><br><br>I definitely understand why Sean ran away with Daniel at the beginning of the game. It&#39;s very highly likely that nobody (or at least the justice system) would&#39;ve believed him even though he did nothing wrong. Although there&#39;s no evidence, a lot of times it&#39;s whoever can sway the jury willing he has a trial by jury. He&#39;s framed as a person of color who allegedly murdered a white cop. <br><br><br>I feel so bad for Sean. It&#39;s insane that he somehow ends up in jail for fifteen years even though he didn&#39;t hurt anyone. I&#39;m not sure if they charged him for the murder of the cop, but it was still upsetting. Not only that, but everyone else who tied him up, assaulted him, basically kidnapped his little brother, and was overall racist towards him received no punishment that we know of. I don&#39;t know if the developers did that on purpose to highlight that often times people get away with violent bigotry and racism, but that part really upset me. I liked the ending that you chose, and I suppose it&#39;s the Good/Best ending but is it really a good/best ending? <br><br><br>Some of the endings didn&#39;t make sense to me. I didn&#39;t understand how Sean was somehow able to survive and escape to Mexico when cops were shooting at him when he didn&#39;t have Daniel&#39;s shield while Daniel suddenly decided to jump out of the car, but somehow died when Daniel used his shield to protect the whole car while pushing and disarming all the cops. I definitely feel like there could&#39;ve been a way for them both to securely escape without Daniel having to abandon Sean and/or Sean dying (besides the last Low Morality choice). I&#39;m sure that&#39;s just the way of the developers showing the &quot;karma&quot; and impact of each choice though. <br><br><br>Overall, it&#39;s a very emotional, realistic, and raw video game and I can&#39;t wait to see what&#39;s next.",2019-12-04T08:07:22Z

City Life is not for him anymore. He can rediscover the wilderness and life on the road, but by choice.<br><br><br>Somehow he becomes Brody.- <br><br><br><br>At least for me, that makes the ending a little better since he&#39;s finally free. Thought you&#39;d like to know.",2019-12-06T01:00:34Z
alliebeemac,"i completely agree with you. i got the blood brothers ending and i&#39;m really glad i did. its by far the best ending in my opinion. I do want to point out that in the lone wolf ending, there&#39;s a news article on the wall about a &quot;massacre at the border&quot;, but in the blood brothers ending, that article isnt there. if they had killed even a few of those cops, it would&#39;ve been called a massacre by the news. so the exclusion of that article tells me that in the blood brothers ending, they were probably just hurt or knocked out, not dead. my daniel and sean are not evil, they just didnt stand for the corrupt system. they just did what they had to do. I&#39;d also like to point out that daniel had no tatoos and overall looked pretty clean, so i dont think they are doing any business with the cartels. with daniel to keep the gangsters off their backs, i think sean is just able to make decent money doing honest work.<br><br>i think some people get confused because the devs&#39; use of the term &quot;morality&quot; but based on my own gameplay, I dont think this is intended to be a gauge between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;, its more like &quot;family first&quot; vs &quot;society first&quot;, as the post game choices screen showed. i like to think of it kind of like the &quot;renegade vs paragon&quot; gauge in the mass effect games. daniel clearly isnt evil, not even in the lone wolf ending, as he easily could&#39;ve killed those gangsters that were making trouble for them, but he didnt. i think he&#39;s more lost in the lone wolf ending because he doesnt have his brother there to help guide him, so as a child all alone in a country who&#39;s language he wasnt fluent in, he sadly fell prey to gangsters and cartels who took advantage of him, and thats really sucks, but in the blood brothers ending, he has his brother to guide him and help him control his power.",2019-12-22T02:13:26Z
alliebeemac,"I got the blood brother ending, which I love and I‚Äôm so happy I got but I got very teary eyes when I watched you ending. Sean looked so broken and tired and it was so hard to see him like that.",2019-12-08T03:28:24Z
alliebeemac,"Omg this episode was a tear-jerker watched it as soon as I got home from work and I knew I was going to cry. I think you chose the best ending. You know I hate seeing you cry Allie, so of course just seeing that made me cry worse. Honestly I think I would have crossed the border because I wanted to be with Daniel. But I would have had high honer so I would have ended up shot. But I agree the best ending is with low honer. Loved your playthrough Allie.(now don&#39;t ever cry again LoL)üíñ",2019-12-04T21:31:19Z
alliebeemac,"Your playthroughs are so fun and entertaining to watch and I love your genuine heartfelt reactions üíöüôÇ I felt they did something truly incredible and took a huge risk with this game. It‚Äôs become my favorite of all time, and I play it constantly and for once, I‚Äôm writing a fanfic, which I never do. But these topics of racism (even subtle points you don‚Äôt see often like the newspaper articles scattered throughout and some of Claire‚Äôs mannerisms and responses), the question of fitting in as mixed race kids, how immigrants are perceived in the US, it was super genuine and real, and I hope people continue to play it and that it opens a lot of hearts and minds. They‚Äôre important issues to me, and I write a lot about them in my own fiction as well. Emotionally, this affected me so much because they really make you care for these boys as if they‚Äôre you‚Äôre own family. Also as far as Daniel consistently learning as you teach him, and all the various little outcomes and dialogue you can uncover, I thought it was a brilliant gameplay mechanic that I‚Äôm not sure has ever been done before.

JazzyGuns,Tips for the impostor: If the last 2 crewmates know damn well its you then sabotage. They cant call a meeting during sabotage.<br>More tips: Sabotaging lights is prob the best sabotage. ppl care less about lights. But they&#39;re quick to fix o2 and reactor. Also if u sabotage lights they cant see u. My strategy is sabotaging lights and killing then venting<br>More tips: If they choose to vote out ur partner u have to vote out ur partner. It makes u blend in. <br>More tips: ALWAYS KILL THE PERSON WATCHING CAMS<br>More tips: If u and ur impostor buddy r together and a crewmate sees u kill frame the crewmate. Its 2 vs 1<br>If u have a pet especially a mini crewmate u have to work faster. Becuase ppl can see ur pet vent with u. <br>More tips: The best map for impostor is polus. The Skeld has a good camera system and mira hq is too linear. Polus gives u a lot of space and the cameras are average. <br>More tips: I would recommend reporting at least 1 body every 2 times ur imposter. Impostors dont report bodies and if u know that nobody knows its a self report u can report.<br>More Tips: TAKE ADVANTAGES OF THE SABOTAGES BEFORE U FIX THEM! Like lights try to get a kill with lights. If you&#39;re grouped up probably not the best idea<br>More tips: If u trap someone kill them quickly. Because if someone sees a body they&#39;ll vote u out<br>More tips: If people r grouped up the best thing u can do is a stack kill or try to separate them<br>More tips: If someone sees u vent trap them or vent next to the button so u can catch them<br>If ur impostor play like u do as a crewmate. If u talk a lot as a crewmate u have to talk a lot as an impostor<br>Don&#39;t frame crewmates if confirm ejects are on. The best way to frame a crewmate is if everybody sees them doing something sus<br>when u fake tasks wait till the bar goes up.,2020-10-20T03:33:46Z

LDShadowLady,i love these episodes! Are you gonna have more minecraft vs? I missed them,2015-09-24T23:48:18Z
LDShadowLady,"One thing that should be said: although you don&#39;t have the advantage of being a Youtuber with the disguised name, you DO have the advantage of choosing the theme, which gives you more time than any of the others to think about how you&#39;re going to build it, meaning that you&#39;ll almost always be able to make much better builds in the time allotted.",2015-09-26T04:45:57Z

LDShadowLady,"Omg. Lizzie, let me just say, you are my favorite youtuber of all time. Many other youtubers  have 30 minutes videos and are super boring.

LDShadowLady,"I&#39;m actually quite surprised how few people seemed to know what a Lucky Cat was. They&#39;ve been commonly associated with Japanese culture since I was little. Also, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been to any family owned fancy Asian restaurant that doesn&#39;t have one somewhere.<br><br>I&#39;d think with that above tidbit and how anime is so popular now along with how frequently they appear in video games that just about everyone would know.<br><br>Had fun watching as always, Lizzie.<br><br>Also, I&#39;ve never commented before and in case you actually do see this I wanted to thank you for helping me feel better with Shadowcraft after my fiancee left me last year. You and other YouTubers videos helped me get through the days when things got especially hard. You&#39;re an inspiration.<br><br><br>Oh, and a theme suggestion: Brave Little Toaster.",2015-09-26T13:36:36Z

LDShadowLady,Maybe I&#39;ll have to send Lizzie some mini furniture on Twitter! :3 I loved the Lucky Cat theme. It reminds me of Animal Crossing. :) ‚ô°,2015-09-24T23:50:32Z

LDShadowLady,"oh I&#39;m so sorry it was over so soon. I had really high hopes for you and wishing you so much luck! It must have felt awful. I would have let you join back on because it was just the first episode.. but then again it is hard core mode Minecraft... I love this series it reminds me of 1 life a friendly grace period, and then a massive purge. Good luck on your next UHShe season.<br>- biggest fan<br>P.S. I LOVE ALL YOUR VIDEOS!!",2018-07-06T15:54:38Z
LDShadowLady,so i feel like the intro somehow foreshadows the death due to lizzie dying in lava so here are my ideas.<br>Pip3rgames-She got shot at the ice biome<br>Aureylian- Died of fall damage<br>Mktheworst- suffocates in leaf block (you can suffocate in leaf blocks while riding a pig)<br>HeyImBee- was murdered while enchanting she was distracted<br>Kaleidow- somehow died due to snowballs (cause of death)<br>Shubble-Died from snowballs (cause of death)<br>Mousie-died in the center<br>Netty- died of TNT<br>Strawburry17- Was blown up to pieces by a creeper while looking at a mineshaft chest<br>lizzy-well.....<br>Yammy-could have ran out of food (was sprinting)<br>stacy-instead of taming she hit them<br>These are all theories and we know someone won.,2015-12-25T03:02:39Z
LDShadowLady,Can we just take a sec to appreciate this AMAZING intro like WOW,2022-01-21T22:17:43Z

LDShadowLady,"GG Lizzie! Speed is key! I will keep that advice!<br>I noticed a lot of people asking to bring Lizzie back. Why don&#39;t people realise the whole point of the game is when you die, that is it? It breaks all the rules bringing someone back into a game. It is the whole point to the game. Not only that this is all pre-recorded and finished. They just schedule uploads every 2 days. You wouldn&#39;t be able to bring her back.",2015-12-21T12:55:44Z

LDShadowLady,Lizzie had the absolutely funniest entrance in the start XD,2015-12-21T05:45:19Z
LDShadowLady,"I have such a good idea. The next time you play UHShe, ok write this down now, go to 0;0 and then around it build those traps where when you step on it you fall to your death. Then what you do is set up camp in the middle then eventually when people come to 0;0 they will see you and run towards you and fall for the trap.",2015-12-22T18:49:29Z

LDShadowLady,"It really makes me sad that Lizzie doesn&#39;t compete anymore... I remember watching this episode when it first came out and how much hate she got for it, and I think that is why she quit UHshe, not just cause of how much hate she got, but how much hate aurailian and Ashley got when they killed her in tbe first and second season and it really makes me sad to see all this hate...",2017-05-17T16:47:18Z

stacyplays,"I&#39;d just like to say: I had a cat, his name was Niamaya. (Nee-UH-mai-UH) When I was little he was not very nice but I still loved him. He was a Ginger cat too. I wish Niamaya had made it to this day but, One day he got outside and my mom searched for him. She came home Empty-Handed and 3 days later he came back but he was peeing all over and we took him to our Grandparents farm. He was then an outdoor cat. He¬†was sadly hit by a truck and it was very sad. But¬†our neighbors had¬†a HUGE litter of kittens and they¬†called and asked if we wanted one. We said yes and she showed¬†up with two kittens and said¬†&quot;You get two&quot; and my mom said &quot;No I only want one!!!!&quot; But my mom eventually gave¬†up, ad now we have two¬†cats, Maggie and Emma. R.I.P.¬† Niamaya &lt;3",2016-07-14T02:08:52Z

If you are reading this Stacy : I adopted this cat because i was inspired by you and your intro which says to rescue a dog, but i rescued a cat instead. I have had Zumi for 1 year after the vet told me he wouldn&#39;t make it due to his illness and then 5 days later he died.",2016-07-06T18:23:27Z

I even mod for someone who orders food on the phone DURING the stream and then goes to get it from the door. Nobody will care if your dog needs attention during a stream. You just need a lot of good mods to make sure people don&#39;t come into your chat acting like trolls. If you ever have any questions, feel free to ask me. :) and if not, then I would suggest talking to BaconDonut, TacticalPinup or even just email twitch headquarters.

Dexbonus,I lived in Seattle for the last 4 years and only just moved to the east coast this year. That video makes me miss it SOOOOoooo MUCH!  Thank you for the nostalgic trip through Pike Place and the reminder that the gum wall is still just as gross/entrancing as I remember.,2012-08-30T22:39:05Z
Dexbonus,"5:34 is just the most adorable.

Thanks for the trip around Seattle, Dodger.  I like these on-the-move vlogs.",2012-08-31T07:22:00Z

Also, it&#39;s interesting to see the world from a Dodger POV.",2012-09-25T01:41:01Z
Dexbonus,Dodger you really need to do more of the on the street vlogs. You&#39;re really good at it. Don&#39;t stop with the coffeh time but maybe once in a while do a walk around blog when you go on set for something. Or go spend the day with Ro. ,2012-08-30T23:46:04Z

Dexbonus,Those duck boat tour type things are available all over the world. If you come to New Zealand you can go on the Rotorua Duck Tours. They are certainty an amazing WWII military landing craft to still be going strong after over 60 years since they first where produced. I know London and Singapore have them and I think I saw an advert for a duck tour in Canada.,2012-08-31T01:39:01Z
Dexbonus,"Oooh so much things you can do in Seattle!!! The other side of the Seattle Wheel is the Alki Beach, if you go there at night there are bunch of people wearing neon colours long boarding and skating and biking... The Paramount theatre is gorgeous- as is the Benaroya Hall in which Seattle Symphony frequently plays in. Art and street performances are Seattle&#39;s proud culture... I wish you lived in Seattle Dodgerrrrrrr",2012-08-30T23:19:19Z

Dexbonus,"I need to take that Ferris Wheel. The only time I ever go to Seattle is special occasions like family from out of town.

You didn&#39;t run into that juggling dude? Err, there&#39;s probably a bunch. There was this one right outside the shops I once sat in the car waiting for the group to catch up and that was my entertainment.

I recommend checking out the library. I love that place. It&#39;s free to get in, the building itself is all sorts of interesting, and each floor has a theme. It&#39;s been a while tho.",2012-08-30T22:52:57Z

Dexbonus,It&#39;s amusing you can tell how tall other people are because of where Dodger holds the camera.,2012-08-30T21:58:53Z
Dexbonus,The gum wall seems kind of cool. And kind of what I&#39;d expect to see if I went to California. Do gold Optimus Primes come with every caraselle ride or with every starbucks purchase?,2012-08-30T22:28:25Z
Dexbonus,"don&#39;t deny it, you know you were lovin&#39; that carousel ride more than you would have the ferris wheel. :)",2012-08-31T01:19:40Z

Dexbonus,So funny and cute! ;-),2012-08-31T05:32:20Z
Dexbonus,"Well, Dodger. I&#39;m so glad to see that you have started going into metalworking. I am a machinist. I make airplane parts for my job. I also machine parts as a hobby in my garage.  It&#39;s a great activity. It is not that expensive because, you can do projects for other people, since most people don&#39;t buy a small milling machine and a lathe. I put a few thousand dollars in my hobby and I don&#39;t regret it at all. It just takes a lot of space and cutting tools can been expensive sometimes. ",2013-01-15T00:56:15Z
Dexbonus,"Was having an unbelievably shitty day, but then I watched the collective awesomeness that is Dodger, Jesse Cox, and TB (the TGS podcast highlights, DIY+Coffeh, Q&amp;A) and I felt a lot better. For this I am ever grateful. ",2013-01-14T07:38:35Z

Dexbonus,One of the multiple reasons I love dodger is that she is a rare breed on the internet. A woman whose video&#39;s screens are half covered with their boobs. Thank you Dodger! ,2013-01-14T08:09:42Z

Dexbonus,I need friends like hers. They sound like they have the best of times together.,2013-01-15T03:17:34Z
Dexbonus,Only problem with the cheaper stamps is you want to stick to the softer metals as the harder metals will blunt the cheap stamps fast. Most of the cheaper stamps are normally for stamping into soft metals or leather only. I have actually used them to also stamp into paper and card!,2013-01-14T08:00:45Z
Dexbonus,"Thank you for the kisses, I feel much better now. I&#39;m glad you are feeling better too! Flea market eh? Huh, yeah one can get a lot of things one does not need in those places. Sometimes it&#39;s pretty great.",2013-01-14T23:49:17Z

Dexbonus,"It&#39;s my birthday soon, I&#39;ll be 25 and people have been suggesting that I &#39;grow up&#39; and all that nonsense.  Luckily, we&#39;ve got Dodger to remind us all that if the moment takes us, we can run around like a little kid, and that&#39;s ok :)",2013-01-14T23:37:28Z

Dexbonus,I miss CA flea markets. I moved to Pennsylvania and there aren&#39;t as good a flea markets unless I want to drive 6 hours to Philly. No one takes cards and its really rare to find anything good. Lots of candle and inflatable pencil ladies. Lots. Those are some awesome finds though :),2013-01-14T08:19:15Z

Dexbonus,"This is true, a rubber mallet is usually a safer alternative to a metal hammer if it is not too large for the task at hand.
That said, the rear end of those stamps are most likely &#39;Tempered&#39;, meaning in layman&#39;s terms, that they will &#39;mushroom&#39; (The edges will begin to fold over, a good example could be an old center punch, or cold chisel), rather than cracking, or shattering.
THAT said, those stamps are designed for use on non-ferrous metals, heated ferrous metals (at LEAST &#39;red&#39; hot), and wood",2013-01-14T11:36:56Z

I mean, you lived through everything you wanted to live through, and there&#39;s no reason for one to get up in the morning, since you are not hoping for progress on anything (if it makes sense)...

Kind of a free roam game when you just beat the final boss.

But I could be wrong, maybe things pop-up while you try doing your main goals!
Like side-quests!

To continue the village quests you need to go under the waterfall in the farm area of the village to get the ancient mask and/ or complete the village request that the elder&#39;s son will have for you to make that mask. Which will unlock the next story quest.,2013-11-01T10:35:02Z

reason most people wanted you to stop was because you kept breaking it to the point that it would just Screech instead...but your panicing makes it more fun :D

Dexbonus,"My friend and I had a long discussion about Meat Loaf on the tube once. It was decided by a bunch of random people that we should have our own TV Show.... (Like, if you have a Meat loaf sandwich do you use the Meat loaf as bread, so it&#39;s some meat loaf surrounded in two slices of meat loaf?&quot; Good times",2012-11-22T11:49:27Z
Dexbonus,"Damn, I was busy all week. It&#39;s great to have an hour to watch youtube :/
and more than 30 minutes of it is gonna be the dex bonus vlogs I missed &lt;3",2012-11-25T20:43:27Z
Dexbonus,"&#39;sooo that&#39;s what&#39;s going on with me... is that apple juice??&#39; dodger, sometimes you are ridiculously cute! that&#39;s why I love coffeh time so much :D",2012-11-23T18:29:34Z
Dexbonus,"Ghost cat? Also, worth remembering that apple juice and urine can look very similar. Be careful!",2012-11-22T09:57:34Z
Dexbonus,the talking about the things and such so cute starting to feel like a weirdo watching the videos just cheers up,2012-11-22T18:44:50Z
Dexbonus,"I like most meatloaf except for this one the local supermarket sells that has a apricot sauce glaze. I prefer the plain one they sell. I also love a scotch egg that is like a big round crumb coated meatloaf with a boiled egg in the center.

You need to be a very confident person to drink an unknown liquid with that particular colour  ",2012-11-22T03:12:37Z
Dexbonus,"My thoughts, exactly! She did mention when somebody sent her a bottle of whiskey that &quot;Whiskey is my Jam!&quot; Jam comes from fruit, apples a fruit. I see the dots and have connected them! Conspiracies! Mmm, apple whiskey.",2012-11-22T03:32:17Z
Dexbonus,Pretty sure Dodger just used a really complicated way to say she made a Spanish Omelette.,2012-11-23T12:37:42Z
Dexbonus,"It&#39;s hilarious to me when I come across holier-than-thou vegans and vegetarians, because I have several vegan and vegetarian friends who are super chill about it. They&#39;re like &quot;You eat meat? That&#39;s cool.&quot;",2012-11-22T04:24:40Z
Dexbonus,My dad&#39;s meatloaf is the best. he also puts onions (which with anything else i hate) and slices of bacon over the top. It is so moist and delicious.,2012-11-22T06:17:44Z
Dexbonus,"I&#39;m also in Nova Scotia, Canada, and the large factory farms of other regions are mostly unknown here.  Most of the meat we get locally is more &quot;old school&quot; - free range, on a farm, not on massive feed lots.  Ditto our agriculture - actual crop rotation OH MAH GERRDS

Dexbonus,I love making some juicy meatloaf.. so moist and delicious.,2012-11-22T05:08:05Z
Dexbonus,"I wanted it to be some type of liquor and then see her make a disgusting/shocked face, but Dodger doesn&#39;t make disgusted faces drinking any alcoholic beverages if TGS Podcast #14&#39;s terrible tasting wine is anything to go off of!",2012-11-22T03:28:12Z
Dexbonus,"Today, a young woman in Oregon was found trapped inside her own hoodie, barely responding to stimuli and severely dehydrated. The local fire department were the first on scene, and they immediately radioed for army grade hydraulic rescue tools, otherwise known as &quot;jaws of life&quot;.
The police questioned the woman, but she refused to give any details on the matter.",2012-11-22T13:42:48Z
Dexbonus,"I love the meatloaf my mom made when I was a kid, She used ketchup and ground beef, oat meal and eggs.
But I have discovered there are different ways people make meatloaf!! they add  sausage to the beef, beef and veal, breadcrumbs, corn breadcrumbs,cornflakes, saltine crackers, egg white or no egg! And some people I hear eat it with Brown Gravy with mushrooms on top Not Ketchup!?!? Seasoning varies upon where you are (restaurant or home, North,South, East or West)I like onion and Green pepper.
 ",2012-11-22T08:13:35Z
Dexbonus,"I love Ketchup Meatloaf myself, mixed in then coated on top then cooked = awesome not that yucky gravy meatloaf",2012-11-22T03:22:49Z
Dexbonus,A scamble is eggs that is scrambled (mixed up) with a variety of ingrediants added to it. Think of it as an omlet that has been cut up and then stuck together again with gooey cheese.,2012-11-22T03:04:05Z
Dexbonus,As much as it makes me a loser to say it I get depressed that I can&#39;t/won&#39;t find someone like Dodger : /,2012-11-22T09:30:58Z
Dexbonus,"Welcome back to Oregon!

Enjoy the crazy weather today? It was ridiculous!",2012-11-22T04:12:07Z

Dexbonus,Meat? In bread?! THAT SOUNDS AWESOME!,2012-11-22T11:37:51Z
Dexbonus,"Meatloaf really depends on how its made... Most of it i hate, some of it i like. Its really up to chance",2012-11-22T06:28:38Z
Dexbonus,"I so wanted that to happen, but according to a TY in which she was sent a bottle she likes whiskey, so her &quot;surprise face&quot; would be like an &quot;ooo&quot;",2012-11-22T06:18:11Z
Dexbonus,LMAO I never noticed that. Thank you for pointing it out. It will make any video 100% more hilarious.,2012-11-22T16:01:45Z
Dexbonus,"if it&#39;s what I think it is - it&#39;s like a less cohesive omlette :) - and much better imo (I usually go either jalapenos, cheese, onions, and corn.... or meat, shredded potatoes, and a bit of sour cream :P)",2012-11-22T03:06:54Z
Dexbonus,Every time Dodger talks about how she likes soy milk in her coffee instead of dairy I jizz myself. Muahaha.,2012-11-23T22:35:21Z

Sqaishey Quack,"Love your videos! You make me smile. I have a suggestion for the chicken farm. You should create a chicken statue and inside it could be the &quot;nursery&quot; for baby chickens and it would be SOOOO cute! Maybe it could be in the middle of the Chicken Town next to the town hall??? Anyways, the &quot;mama chickens&quot; could come in and see the chickens, and when they grow up, they move out. Just an idea! Love you!",2014-11-07T22:08:00Z

KittyKatGaming,"i don&#39;t know if this game is really¬†hard or i just looking down upon it&#39;s difficulty,<br>i only see 5 possible button the same as guitar heroes series where you only need to press 1 button every few sec.<br><br>missed 1 button for every 40 chain is considered average in guitar heroes.<br>but this game seems far easier but with higher penalty rate for failure.<br>new player might found it&#39;s hard but i believe most people¬†can finish this game sequence at first try.<br>(unless it takes hours to finish this game where people with low concentration will start losing focus)",2018-05-20T11:51:30Z
KittyKatGaming,"wow, in the before time, game makers would spend money to make the games before selling them...today they collect money from you and then sell it to you while spending as little as possible on the actual game....hmhmhmh",2018-05-16T18:01:46Z
